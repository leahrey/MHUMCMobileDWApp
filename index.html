  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Impossibility is God's Speciality<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong>  Ephesians 2:8, John 3:16, Luke 2:9, Philippians 2:6 - 7, Romans 5:18 - 19, Philippians 10:9-2, John 1:12<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br />
    <br />
Christmas is a time of giving. This pattern of giving began in Ephesians 2:8 - For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.<br />
<br />
<strong>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong><br />
<br />
When we consider the gift of God we must reflect on Luke 2:9 - And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.<br />
<br />
The child that was born was humanity; the son that was given is divinity. The word became flesh and dwelt among us.<br />
<br />
While the world goes about it's business of sales and markdowns; God sends his son wrapped in swaddling clothes and born in a manger. He was given a common name, Jesus. But there was something special about this birth.<br />
<br />
God had already pre-ordained the inn being full and the child being born in the manger. Do you have room for Jesus? Or is your life so full of clutter that you are focusing on other people and things.<br />
<br />
How well do you treat others?<br />
<br />
Be careful how we entertain strangers, we could be entertaining an angel.<br />
<br />
The angel announced his birth, his resurrection, and will announce his return.<br />
<br />
God has plans that we can't change.<br />
<br />
The Relevance of Christmas - <strong>Philippians 2:6 - 7 - Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. </strong><br />
<br />
He became like us so we may be like him.<br />
<br />
Christ came to the lowly, to shepherds in the fields watching their flock. He didn't come to the affluent and the high.<br />
<br />
When you are wrapped up in your affairs you can't see the gift. We have lists, goals and plans but don't focus on Jesus.<br />
<br />
God became a man that's the meaning of Christmas!<br />
<br />
Jesus was born like us, he grew like us and was tempted like us; so he can understand us and our struggles.<br />
<br />
Jesus came to die for us all.<br />
<br />
He came as a sacrifice - the ultimate sacrifice.<br />
<br />
<strong>Romans 5:18 - 19 - Therefore as by the offense of one's judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Christ's obedience to God's plan to make us righteous after Adam's sin made us all sinners. </strong><br />
<br />
The issue is not whether you will admit that Jesus was born because according to <strong>Philippians 10:9-2</strong> - <strong>Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that he is Lord. </strong><br />
<br />
Christ loved us, when we didn't know how to love.<br />
<br />
On December 25th there will be a multitude opening gifts and the greatest gift will be standing at the door knocking.<br />
<br />
If you open the door, he will come in.<br />
<br />
<strong>John 1:12 - But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. </strong>We must receive him.<br />
<br />
Jesus is the reason for the season.</div>

    <h1>Are You Bound or Are You Free?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> December 7, 2014<br />
    <strong></strong><br />
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Jeremiah 8:18, Titus 2:13, Titus 1:16, 2 Timothy 2:5<br />
    <strong></strong><br />
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Are You Bound or Are You Free?<br />
    <br />
Jeremiah 8:18 – When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. Titus 2:13 – &quot;while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ&quot;<br />
<br />
Christ will come at the least expected time. <br />
<br />
As it was in the day of Noah, so is it now. The Lord himself shall descend from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first. <br />
<br />
When the trumpet sounds, everything will stop!<br />
<br />
When Christ returns the first time, he will return for his church. The dead in Christ shall rise, first. When Christ returns the second time, he will return for judgment. Those who did not rise the first time, will rise to be judged by Christ. <br />
<br />
<strong>Matthew 25</strong> – He shall separate them one from another to judge.<br />
<br />
Are you bound or are you free? There can be no &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;I think so&quot;. You must be sure.<br />
<br />
Some profess that they believe in God. Demons also believe that God exists. <br />
<br />
Some claim to know God – but deny him by the way they live. They praise God on Sunday and cut up when they leave the church.<br />
<br />
God calls on us to be holy.<br />
<br />
<strong>2 Timothy 2:5 </strong><strong>– </strong>Preach the word – for the time will come when you will not endure sound doctrine. <br />
<br />
<br />
We are in the last days. The last days began at the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. We have always been in the last days.<br />
<br />
<strong>Psalm 9:17</strong> – &quot;The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God&quot; – We must pray for those who don&rsquo;t know Christ. <br />
<br />
<br />
We must let go of un-thankfulness, un-forgiveness and being un-loving. If you let go of those things, your health will improve.<br />
<br />
Don&rsquo;t let craziness put you in the ground.<br />
<br />
The word of God explains our position, right now.<br />
<br />
Don&rsquo;t judge unless the real judge will judge you. <br />
<strong><br />
</strong> <strong>Proverbs</strong> <strong>6 </strong>– These things the lord hates<br />
<br />
Some of us are quick to destroy someone&rsquo;s reputation. Regularly attend church service- on every committee, but won&rsquo;t submit to the authority of Christ. <br />
<br />
Obedience and love are the traits of a Christian.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong> – You must obey your leader. He must give an account for everyone in the congregation.<br />
<br />
<strong>1 Peter 4:17</strong> – For the time has come for judgment to being in the house of the Lord. God will judge the church first. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Matthew 22</strong> - Love your neighbors as you love yourself. Let&rsquo;s not be selfish or self-centered. <br />
We can&rsquo;t be prideful in positions. <br />
<strong><br />
</strong> <strong>1 Corinthians 13:14</strong> – Don&rsquo;t be puffed up. Love never gives up – Love cares more for others than self.<br />
<br />
If you yield yourself to things that aren&rsquo;t of God you are under the control of whatever you yield to.<br />
We are blessed and saved – all of our needs are met and we represent Christ. </div>

    <h1>Starting Over</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <div><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Starting Over</div>
    <div><strong>Date:</strong> November 23, 2014</div>
    <div><strong><br />
      Scripture: </strong>Philippians 3:7-14, Philippians 4:8, John 5:7</div>
    <div><strong><br />
      Notes</strong>:<br />
  <br />
      How do you begin again? When your life has been interrupted by failed relationships, trials and tragedy it is difficult to let go and start over. Starting over is a process. Some steps are crucial to starting over successfully.<br />
  <br />
    </div>
    <div>Letting go – there are probably things that you hold onto that you&rsquo;ve held on to for years.</div>
    <div>There are times in life when you have to let go of people – places and things. The one thing that keeps you from your destiny is your past.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>Philippians 3:7-14 – Sometimes we don&rsquo;t understand life. That&rsquo;s why we must wait on the Lord.</div>
    <div>It&rsquo;s easy to form an attachment to people or things and it&rsquo;s hard to let go. Every person that comes into your life has a purpose or aren&rsquo;t in your life to stay. Some folks don&rsquo;t mean you well. Have no fellowship with them.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>Letting go can be painful. The intolerance of your present will create your future. Every relationship is a current – it moves you towards your dream or away from your dreams.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>Hanging on to resentment allows someone to live rent free in your head. Never let someone build your world for you. They will build it too small.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>Forget about the past – don&rsquo;t let others remind you of the past. When you don&rsquo;t forgive you put yourself in a box.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>If you want to start over you must first deal with the damage. Ask the right questions. Starting over will be rough, but we will make it. I&rsquo;m not going to allow anything to stop me.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>Many are the afflictions of the righteous. The difference between success and failure is how you handle pressure.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>There are times when the enemy will put you in the pressure cooker. But God has the power. Just like the palm tree – we can bend, but we won&rsquo;t break.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div><strong>Three ways to help you let go</strong></div>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li> Enjoy yourself - don&rsquo;t let anything get you down.  Those who control the pain of today can&rsquo;t control the pleasure of tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Release the grief – emotions of anger, fear and labels – there is something more precious in you than what people say.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t rehearse your failures tomorrow is another day. Get over it – if you keep talking about it, you will be right back where you were. Don&rsquo;t allow others to remind you. If you worry and pity yourself, you will become a pitiful person that no one wants to be around.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Life won&rsquo;t always be happy. You&rsquo;re not always going to wake up on the sunny side of the street – deal with it.<br />
      <br />
      Happiness doesn&rsquo;t depend on who you are – it depends on how you think.<br />
  <br />
      Philippians 4:8 – Think on these things, think on the positive and not the negative. If you allow yourself to think about the negative you will find plenty of negative things to think about.<br />
  <br />
      Wake up in the morning with a positive attitude. Wake up and be thankful for another day.<br />
  <br />
      Don&rsquo;t repress it – Don&rsquo;t hold it in – Some people hold stuff in and then one day, they explode. Let it out – don&rsquo;t hold it in. Don&rsquo;t hold on to the pain, disappointment and old negative memories.<br />
  <br />
      Release it! Life isn&rsquo;t a dress rehearsal, stop practicing and just do it!<br />
  <br />
      Stop making excuses – <strong>John 5:7</strong> – Jesus was asking the man at the pool if he wanted to be healed. The man had wasted over 30 years sitting near the pool. When Jesus came to him, the man gave Jesus nothing but excuses for his condition.<br />
  <br />
      Some of the people that you wait to help you won&rsquo;t. They either can&rsquo;t help you, don&rsquo;t have time or don&rsquo;t really want you to succeed.<br />
  <br />
      What you say sets the stage for your life. Stop talking crazy stuff, it impacts your life.<br />
  <br />
      By your words you are justified, by your words, you will be condemned. Your victory is as close as the roof of your mouth.<br />
  <br />
      You must only speak positive things. Things turn out for the best – for those who make the best of things.<br />
  <br />
      You are not a loser, you&rsquo;re a winner. Dr. King once said, take the first step in faith. You don&rsquo;t have to see the whole staircase to take the first step.<br />
  <br />
      Accept what you can&rsquo;t change – focus on what you can. Tell God exactly how you feel – Don&rsquo;t tell other people. Others can&rsquo;t help you. Resist bitterness and ask yourself, do I want to be bitter or happy.<br />
  <br />
      When you harbor bitterness – you end up with sickness and illnesses. Cast your cares on him – for he cares. When you awake – spend time worshiping God – Don&rsquo;t make requests.<br />
  <br />
      Thank him – In all things, I give you praise.<br />
  <br />
      When you thank God for a little, you end up with a lot.Gratitude destroys depression. No born again person should be depressed or stressed. The church is more than a building. It&rsquo;s all about people helping people. Live life with eternity in view. Don&rsquo;t wait until the conditions are perfect.<br />
  <br />
      They&rsquo;ll never be perfect. Let go and remind yourself that this moment is the only one that we can be sure of – in this next breath we could be gone.<br />
  <br />
      Start over, Let it Go!</p>

    <h1>We must desire the sincere milk of the word</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> November 16, 2014<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Scripture:</strong> Hosea 4:6, Galatians 3:3, 2 Timothy 3, 1 John 25, Psalms 119:113, Job 23:12<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> We must desire the sincere milk of the word<br />
Spiritual growth is the development of a Christ like character and faith that has to test our faith. Our faith will be tested. <br />
<br />
Being like Christ should be our goal. We must desire the sincere milk of the word in order to grow. <br />
Early will I seek thee. We need the word in our spirit and mind. We need to meditate, read and hear the word of God.<br />
<br />
Forsake not the assembly of saints – God speaks to the under-shepherd and the under-shepherd speaks to the sheep. <br />
<br />
<strong>Hosea 4:6</strong> – my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. We as the saints of God are priesthood for non-believers. <br />
<br />
The mark of maturity is not to be tossed to and fro and not to listen to other doctrines or teachings. You must know truth. <br />
<br />
Present your body as a living sacrifice. Be not conformed to the world but transformed by the renewing of your mind. Put off the former conversations. Don&rsquo;t be judgmental or gossiper. Put off the former man. <br />
Some people prey on you while they say they&rsquo;re praying for you. Grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord. <br />
<br />
We should all strive to mature. Philippians 3:13 – Yesterday is gone – we must leave it behind – stop resurrecting dead things. Stop losing sleep over it, tomorrow is a new day.<br />
It is he who causes spiritual growth.<br />
<br />
<strong>Galatians 3:3</strong> – Why are you trying to become perfect with your own effort?<br />
<strong>2 Timothy 3</strong> – Scripture reveals to us what is wrong with our lives. <br />
<strong>1 John 25</strong> – We know that he dwells in us and we keep his word. <br />
<strong>Psalms 119:113</strong> – I hate lies but I love the word of the Lord. <br />
<strong>Job 23:12</strong> – God&rsquo;s word is needed more than my necessary food. Growth takes effort. It takes commitment and dedication. Seek those things that are above where Christ sits. Set your sights on things above and not on the earth. <br />
<br />
Walk upright before him. Change is inevitable. Growth is optional. <br />
<br />
You must change – you don&rsquo;t have to grow.<br />
<br />
God will take you anywhere you want to go, but he can&rsquo;t take you if you don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
The word you memorize is the word that you will utilize.<br />
<br />
Grow in your relationships. Grow in the knowledge of God and we can make things better.</div>
