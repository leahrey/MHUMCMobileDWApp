    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Impossibility is God's Speciality<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong>  Ephesians 2:8, John 3:16, Luke 2:9, Philippians 2:6 - 7, Romans 5:18 - 19, Philippians 10:9-2, John 1:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      Christmas is a time of giving. This pattern of giving began in Ephesians 2:8 - For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong><br>
      <br>
      When we consider the gift of God we must reflect on Luke 2:9 - And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.<br>
      <br>
      The child that was born was humanity; the son that was given is divinity. The word became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
      <br>
      While the world goes about it's business of sales and markdowns; God sends his son wrapped in swaddling clothes and born in a manger. He was given a common name, Jesus. But there was something special about this birth.<br>
      <br>
      God had already pre-ordained the inn being full and the child being born in the manger. Do you have room for Jesus? Or is your life so full of clutter that you are focusing on other people and things.<br>
      <br>
      How well do you treat others?<br>
      <br>
      Be careful how we entertain strangers, we could be entertaining an angel.<br>
      <br>
      The angel announced his birth, his resurrection, and will announce his return.<br>
      <br>
      God has plans that we can't change.<br>
      <br>
      The Relevance of Christmas - <strong>Philippians 2:6 - 7 - Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. </strong><br>
      <br>
      He became like us so we may be like him.<br>
      <br>
      Christ came to the lowly, to shepherds in the fields watching their flock. He didn't come to the affluent and the high.<br>
      <br>
      When you are wrapped up in your affairs you can't see the gift. We have lists, goals and plans but don't focus on Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      God became a man that's the meaning of Christmas!<br>
      <br>
      Jesus was born like us, he grew like us and was tempted like us; so he can understand us and our struggles.<br>
      <br>
      Jesus came to die for us all.<br>
      <br>
      He came as a sacrifice - the ultimate sacrifice.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 5:18 - 19 - Therefore as by the offense of one's judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Christ's obedience to God's plan to make us righteous after Adam's sin made us all sinners. </strong><br>
      <br>
      The issue is not whether you will admit that Jesus was born because according to <strong>Philippians 10:9-2</strong> - <strong>Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that he is Lord. </strong><br>
      <br>
      Christ loved us, when we didn't know how to love.<br>
      <br>
      On December 25th there will be a multitude opening gifts and the greatest gift will be standing at the door knocking.<br>
      <br>
      If you open the door, he will come in.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>John 1:12 - But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. </strong>We must receive him.<br>
      <br>
    Jesus is the reason for the season.</p>

    <h1>Are You Bound or Are You Free?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> December 7, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id ="image"><img src="waterfallsm.jpg" width="150" height="94"><br></div>
    <strong></strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Jeremiah 8:18, Titus 2:13, Titus 1:16, 2 Timothy 2:5<br>
    <strong></strong><br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Are You Bound or Are You Free?<br>
    <br>
    Jeremiah 8:18 – When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. Titus 2:13 – "while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ"<br>
    <br>
    Christ will come at the least expected time. <br>
    <br>
    As it was in the day of Noah, so is it now. The Lord himself shall descend from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first. <br>
    <br>
    When the trumpet sounds, everything will stop!<br>
    <br>
    When Christ returns the first time, he will return for his church. The dead in Christ shall rise, first. When Christ returns the second time, he will return for judgment. Those who did not rise the first time, will rise to be judged by Christ. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 25</strong> – He shall separate them one from another to judge.<br>
    <br>
    Are you bound or are you free? There can be no "maybe" or "I think so". You must be sure.<br>
    <br>
    Some profess that they believe in God. Demons also believe that God exists. <br>
    <br>
    Some claim to know God – but deny him by the way they live. They praise God on Sunday and cut up when they leave the church.<br>
    <br>
    God calls on us to be holy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 2:5 </strong><strong>– </strong>Preach the word – for the time will come when you will not endure sound doctrine. <br>
    <br>
    We are in the last days. The last days began at the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. We have always been in the last days.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 9:17</strong> – "The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God" – We must pray for those who don&rsquo;t know Christ. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We must let go of un-thankfulness, un-forgiveness and being un-loving. If you let go of those things, your health will improve.<br>
    <br>
    Don&rsquo;t let craziness put you in the ground.<br>
    <br>
    The word of God explains our position, right now.<br>
    <br>
    Don&rsquo;t judge unless the real judge will judge you. <br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong> <strong>Proverbs</strong> <strong>6 </strong>– These things the lord hates<br>
    <br>
    Some of us are quick to destroy someone&rsquo;s reputation. Regularly attend church service- on every committee, but won&rsquo;t submit to the authority of Christ. <br>
    <br>
    Obedience and love are the traits of a Christian.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong> – You must obey your leader. He must give an account for everyone in the congregation.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Peter 4:17</strong> – For the time has come for judgment to being in the house of the Lord. God will judge the church first. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 22</strong> - Love your neighbors as you love yourself. Let&rsquo;s not be selfish or self-centered. <br>
    We can&rsquo;t be prideful in positions. <br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong> <strong>1 Corinthians 13:14</strong> – Don&rsquo;t be puffed up. Love never gives up – Love cares more for others than self.<br>
    <br>
    If you yield yourself to things that aren&rsquo;t of God you are under the control of whatever you yield to.<br>
  We are blessed and saved – all of our needs are met and we represent Christ. </div>

    <h1>Starting Over</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <div><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Starting Over<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="road.jpg" width="150" height="100"></div></div>
    <div><strong>Date:</strong> November 23, 2014</div>
    <div><strong><br>
      Scripture: </strong>Philippians 3:7-14, Philippians 4:8, John 5:7</div>
    <div><strong><br>
      Notes</strong>:<br>
      <br>
      How do you begin again? When your life has been interrupted by failed relationships, trials and tragedy it is difficult to let go and start over. Starting over is a process. Some steps are crucial to starting over successfully.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Letting go – there are probably things that you hold onto that you&rsquo;ve held on to for years.</div>
    <div>There are times in life when you have to let go of people – places and things. The one thing that keeps you from your destiny is your past.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Philippians 3:7-14 – Sometimes we don&rsquo;t understand life. That&rsquo;s why we must wait on the Lord.</div>
    <div>It&rsquo;s easy to form an attachment to people or things and it&rsquo;s hard to let go. Every person that comes into your life has a purpose or aren&rsquo;t in your life to stay. Some folks don&rsquo;t mean you well. Have no fellowship with them.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Letting go can be painful. The intolerance of your present will create your future. Every relationship is a current – it moves you towards your dream or away from your dreams.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Hanging on to resentment allows someone to live rent free in your head. Never let someone build your world for you. They will build it too small.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Forget about the past – don&rsquo;t let others remind you of the past. When you don&rsquo;t forgive you put yourself in a box.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>If you want to start over you must first deal with the damage. Ask the right questions. Starting over will be rough, but we will make it. I&rsquo;m not going to allow anything to stop me.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Many are the afflictions of the righteous. The difference between success and failure is how you handle pressure.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>There are times when the enemy will put you in the pressure cooker. But God has the power. Just like the palm tree – we can bend, but we won&rsquo;t break.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div><strong>Three ways to help you let go</strong></div>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li> Enjoy yourself - don&rsquo;t let anything get you down.  Those who control the pain of today can&rsquo;t control the pleasure of tomorrow.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Release the grief – emotions of anger, fear and labels – there is something more precious in you than what people say.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t rehearse your failures tomorrow is another day. Get over it – if you keep talking about it, you will be right back where you were. Don&rsquo;t allow others to remind you. If you worry and pity yourself, you will become a pitiful person that no one wants to be around.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Life won&rsquo;t always be happy. You&rsquo;re not always going to wake up on the sunny side of the street – deal with it.<br>
      <br>
      Happiness doesn&rsquo;t depend on who you are – it depends on how you think.<br>
      <br>
      Philippians 4:8 – Think on these things, think on the positive and not the negative. If you allow yourself to think about the negative you will find plenty of negative things to think about.<br>
      <br>
      Wake up in the morning with a positive attitude. Wake up and be thankful for another day.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t repress it – Don&rsquo;t hold it in – Some people hold stuff in and then one day, they explode. Let it out – don&rsquo;t hold it in. Don&rsquo;t hold on to the pain, disappointment and old negative memories.<br>
      <br>
      Release it! Life isn&rsquo;t a dress rehearsal, stop practicing and just do it!<br>
      <br>
      Stop making excuses – <strong>John 5:7</strong> – Jesus was asking the man at the pool if he wanted to be healed. The man had wasted over 30 years sitting near the pool. When Jesus came to him, the man gave Jesus nothing but excuses for his condition.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the people that you wait to help you won&rsquo;t. They either can&rsquo;t help you, don&rsquo;t have time or don&rsquo;t really want you to succeed.<br>
      <br>
      What you say sets the stage for your life. Stop talking crazy stuff, it impacts your life.<br>
      <br>
      By your words you are justified, by your words, you will be condemned. Your victory is as close as the roof of your mouth.<br>
      <br>
      You must only speak positive things. Things turn out for the best – for those who make the best of things.<br>
      <br>
      You are not a loser, you&rsquo;re a winner. Dr. King once said, take the first step in faith. You don&rsquo;t have to see the whole staircase to take the first step.<br>
      <br>
      Accept what you can&rsquo;t change – focus on what you can. Tell God exactly how you feel – Don&rsquo;t tell other people. Others can&rsquo;t help you. Resist bitterness and ask yourself, do I want to be bitter or happy.<br>
      <br>
      When you harbor bitterness – you end up with sickness and illnesses. Cast your cares on him – for he cares. When you awake – spend time worshiping God – Don&rsquo;t make requests.<br>
      <br>
      Thank him – In all things, I give you praise.<br>
      <br>
      When you thank God for a little, you end up with a lot.Gratitude destroys depression. No born again person should be depressed or stressed. The church is more than a building. It&rsquo;s all about people helping people. Live life with eternity in view. Don&rsquo;t wait until the conditions are perfect.<br>
      <br>
      They&rsquo;ll never be perfect. Let go and remind yourself that this moment is the only one that we can be sure of – in this next breath we could be gone.<br>
      <br>
    Start over, Let it Go!</p>

    <h1>We must desire the sincere milk of the word</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 16, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="bible.jpg" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <strong>Scripture:</strong> Hosea 4:6, Galatians 3:3, 2 Timothy 3, 1 John 25, Psalms 119:113, Job 23:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> We must desire the sincere milk of the word<br>
      <br>
      Spiritual growth is the development of a Christ like character and faith that has to test our faith. Our faith will be tested. <br>
      <br>
      Being like Christ should be our goal. We must desire the sincere milk of the word in order to grow. <br>
      <br>
      Early will I seek thee. We need the word in our spirit and mind. We need to meditate, read and hear the word of God.<br>
      <br>
      Forsake not the assembly of saints – God speaks to the under-shepherd and the under-shepherd speaks to the sheep. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Hosea 4:6</strong> – my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. We as the saints of God are priesthood for non-believers. <br>
  <br>
      The mark of maturity is not to be tossed to and fro and not to listen to other doctrines or teachings. You must know truth. <br>
      <br>
      Present your body as a living sacrifice. Be not conformed to the world but transformed by the renewing of your mind. Put off the former conversations. Don&rsquo;t be judgmental or gossiper. Put off the former man. <br>
      <br>
      Some people prey on you while they say they&rsquo;re praying for you. Grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      We should all strive to mature. Philippians 3:13 – Yesterday is gone – we must leave it behind – stop resurrecting dead things. Stop losing sleep over it, tomorrow is a new day.<br>
      <br>
      It is he who causes spiritual growth.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 3:3</strong> – Why are you trying to become perfect with your own effort?<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 3</strong> – Scripture reveals to us what is wrong with our lives. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 John 25</strong> – We know that he dwells in us and we keep his word. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalms 119:113</strong> – I hate lies but I love the word of the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Job 23:12</strong> – God&rsquo;s word is needed more than my necessary food. Growth takes effort. It takes commitment and dedication. Seek those things that are above where Christ sits. Set your sights on things above and not on the earth. <br>
      <br>
      Walk upright before him. Change is inevitable. Growth is optional. <br>
      <br>
      You must change – you don&rsquo;t have to grow.<br>
      <br>
      God will take you anywhere you want to go, but he can&rsquo;t take you if you don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The word you memorize is the word that you will utilize.<br>
      <br>
      Grow in your relationships. Grow in the knowledge of God and we can make things better.</p>

      <h1>Understand the Real You</h1>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 11, 2015<div class="ui-li-aside" id="mirror"><img src="mirror.jpg" width="150" height="174"></div>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Understand the Real You<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Scriptures: </strong>Galatians 5:23, 2 Peter 1:3, Hosea 3:6, 2 Corinthians 2:11, 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, Jeremiah 15:16, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 1 6:8<strong></strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
        <br>
        Worry leads to stress which leads to diseases. A lot of people are in the hospital and sick because they are worried about what they can&rsquo;t change. <br>
        <br>
        Worry is a sin! You can&rsquo;t worry and believe God or pray a prayer of faith and worry. We must understand who we really are. <br>
        We are spirit beings – living in this body – we have a soul.<br>
        <br>
        The soulless areas are: your mind, your will, imagination, intellect<br>
        <br>
        Worry is caused by a lack of information or misinformation. Unless you&rsquo;re grounded in God&rsquo;s word, you receive untruths as truth. There are some things that may be a fact, but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the truth. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If you don&rsquo;t know the truth you&rsquo;re still in bondage. When you&rsquo;re in bondage you&rsquo;re unaware of what you already have. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>Galatians 5:23 – Gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</strong> Peace is a fruit of the spirit. <br>
  <br>
        Perfect peace is the only peace that comes from God. You can get a semblance of peace but if it&rsquo;s not from God it&rsquo;s only a semblance of peace, not perfect peace. <br>
        <br>
        If you&rsquo;re not aware of your peace it causes us to worry. <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. </strong>He gave us all these things. Once we get to know God – We&rsquo;ll understand. We must have knowledge.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 2:11 – In order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. </strong>The enemy has been doing this from the beginning. Unless you know the truth you&rsquo;ll believe a lie. <br>
  <br>
        We have the spirit of man and the spirit of God. We must first present our body as a living sacrifice and our minds must be transformed. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>There are 3 Type of People</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Natural Man – has no relationships with Christ. The things of God are foolish to him.</li>
        <li>Spirit Man – Living under the control of the holy spirit and minds the things of the spirit. Led by the spirit – lower animal passions have been crucified. Galatians 2 – Not I but Christ lives in me. </li>
        <li>Carnal Man – The carnal man is the immature Christian. Operates at a childhood level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:1-3 – Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly – mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</strong> <br>
        <br>
        When you are always involved in something negative – there&rsquo;s a problem. <br>
        <br>
        To know what&rsquo;s been given to us. We must desire the sincere milk of the word.<br>
        Early will I seek thee. Early when I rise – give me Jesus. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>The instructions you follow, will determine the future you create.</strong><br>
  <br>
        Develop new thought patterns. <br>
        <br>
        Your thoughts will determine your decisions, your decisions determine your action, your actions determine your habits, your habits develop your character, your character determines your destiny. <br>
        <br>
        Don&rsquo;t work on anything else – work on your character.<br>
        The knowledge of God brings peace, prosperity and promotion.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 15:16 – When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart&rsquo;s delight, for I bear your name, Lord God Almighty.</strong> We stand on the word. The word is a solid foundation that won&rsquo;t change.<br>
  <br>
        Don&rsquo;t get anxious, concerned or tied up with the world. God is our strength and refuge. <br>
        <br>
        God has promised that he won&rsquo;t hold back anything if we walk upright.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 6:3 – We put no stumbling block in anyone&rsquo;s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</strong> Nothing can upset me. I&rsquo;m not offended! <br>
        You can&rsquo;t be offended. Get your feelings off your sleeve. You can do anything, if you&rsquo;re not offended. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Peter 1 6:8 – and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> </p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t be offended by everything. Get virtue and knowledge. Get temperance.<br>
        Discipline yourself. You must have self-control.</p>

    <strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> The Laws of Prayer<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Ephesians 3:13, Romans 13:1, Luke 10:19 -20, John 13:14<strong>, </strong>Hebrews 11:6, Hebrews 4:16, Mark 11:24-25, 1 John 5:14, 2 Chronicles 20:17, Romans 8:26, Philippians 4:6, Psalm 34:1, Joshua 23:14, Romans 8:38-39, 1 Peter 4:12, Psalm 33:9, Matthew 20:29<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
God&rsquo;s commitment to his purpose will never violate his spoken word. Prayers are not only effective in our lives it&rsquo;s also effective in the lives of those we pray for. Paul prayed for wisdom and understanding for the church in Ephesians. Jesus Christ, savior is the same as Christ our Lord. <br>
<br>
<strong>Ephesians 3:13 – I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. </strong><br>
<br>
Prerequisite for prayer - Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask God for what you need, according to his word. <br>
You must be rooted and grounded in the word. There must be a foundation.<br>
<br>
      James said to call on those who are seasoned in the word to pray. Everyone can&rsquo;t pray for you. Some people don&rsquo;t have the right mindset or their relationship isn&rsquo;t in order. Our primary focus should be to pray for others instead of for ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      If we only pray for ourselves, our prayer lives become selfish. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Romans 13:1 – Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</strong> The powers that be are ordained by God. Every leader in place has been placed there for a reason.<br>
  <br>
      Whoever resists that power, resist God and face damnation. We must obey those who are over us.<br>
      <br>
      We are heaven&rsquo;s representative in the earth. God gave the power to man in the earth. <br>
      <strong>Luke 10:19 -20 – I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.</strong> Prayer pleads the name of Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      We are heaven&rsquo;s representative in the earth. God gave the power to man in the earth.<br>
    <strong>John 13:14 – You call me &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet. </strong>There is an order to our prayers. We yield to the will of Christ in prayer. </p>
    <p>The following are key components to answered prayers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faith</li>
      <li>Praise</li>
      <li>Adoration</li>
      <li>Worship</li>
      <li>Confession</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>8 Laws of Prayer</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faith</strong> – we must have faith when we approach God. Hebrews 11:6 – with faith in God, I am not anxious about anything. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Boldness</strong> – Hebrews 4:16 We don&rsquo;t pray in a state of worry. You must come boldly to the throne. Know that he is a rewarder. You have the right to make your requests to God.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Right relationship</strong> – We need to have the right relationship. Everything we discuss must be in place. Mark 11:24-25 Un-forgiveness is one of the reasons for unanswered prayers. We need to forgive.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>The will of God -</strong> 1 John 5:14 When you ask according to his will, he hears us. When I rely on God and his promises I have the assurance that what I ask of God I shall receive. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Confidence </strong>– We must be confident that God will work in every area of our lives. 2 Chronicles 20:17. Conviction of God – Stand still and see the salvation. We must have confidence in every promise of God in every aspect. Never allow anything, anyone or any circumstance to cause you to doubt the word of God. God won&rsquo;t change. You can stand on the word of God. Be careful – don&rsquo;t allow time to change your belief system, because God has already told us that his way is not our way. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t pre-determine how God will answer your prayers - </strong>Philippians 4:6 – We have a promise, an agreement from God. I have confidence that when God answers my prayer, it will satisfy my needs. He knew what we needed before we asked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The law of the Holy Spirit Romans 8:26 – The blood of Jesus. You can plead the blood. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The law of praise</strong> – Psalm 34:1 - has nothing to do with how you feel or what you&rsquo;re dealing with, you will bless the Lord at all times. No matter what is going on in my life – praise is coming out.  He inhabits the praise of his people. Praises brings God into the midst of whatever we are dealing with.<br>
         </li>
      <li><strong>Reverence</strong> – You must fear God. You have the power to deliver when you have reverence for God. Everything is predicated on our faith in God.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no want for those who have faith in Christ – cast away anxieties, if you believe it, you shall have it. We have confidence in God&rsquo;s deliverance, word and promises<br>
      We must love the word<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Joshua 23:14 - Heaven and earth will pass away but my word will stand forever. </strong>My confidence must be centered in Christ. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Romans 8:38-39 – For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[a] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39&nbsp;neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong> Paul wrote that nothing will separate us from the love of God. We must be mindful in our prayer life that nothing will separate us from God&rsquo;s love. Confidence enables us to endure. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1 Peter 4:12 – Blessed are you if you are enduring. When you suffer God is glorified.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be surprised. The same thing that happens to us happens to everyone, but since we are the body of Christ we will be delivered. <br>
  <br>
      Judgment begins with us first.<br>
      <br>
      We have the assurance that God will keep us.<br>
      <br>
      I am a child of God<br>
      <br>
      I am saved and sanctified <br>
      <br>
      I have the heart of God on my mind<br>
      <br>
      If I have iniquity in my heart God won&rsquo;t hear me. When you pray to God remove all distractions, come to God alone. <br>
      <br>
      Give God glory when you pray. Give to others out of the abundance of what God has given to you. Jesus loves a cheerful giver. Remain in the anointing. Honor the Lord by reflecting the anointing. They should be able to see that you&rsquo;re a Christian. <br>
      <br>
      You are the light of the world. Cultivate the God kind of faith. Negative faith and positive faith can come by the same means – What we listen to and what we believe. Everyone has faith. We need the God-kind of faith if we want to operate in the kingdom.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Psalm 33:9 – For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</strong> He spoke and it was done. God spoke the universe into existence. When you ask for something in prayer, keep speaking about it and it will manifest. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Remember that what you say is a reflection of your heart.<br>
  <br>
      Faith is combined with expectation and action. <br>
  <br>
      Never allow the enemy to make you profess negativity. If you say you won&rsquo;t get it – you don&rsquo;t get it.<br>
      <br>
      They preach themselves out of it.  </p>

    <h1>Understanding Prayer</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 11, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="prayinghands.jpg" width="150" height="187"></div>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Colossians 3:12, 1 Corinthians 13, Philippians 3:7-8, John 1:12, Romans 4:21, Hebrews 11, John 20:31, Psalm 125:1, Psalm 119, Ezekiel 22:30, 1 Peter 2:9, John 16:23, 2 Corinthians 10:4, Ephesians 1:3, Psalm 27, Galatians 5:16, Philippians 4: 6<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Understanding Prayer<br>
      <br>
There is an absolute connection between faith and prayer. How do I turn what the scripture says into the way I live? <br>
<br>
<strong>Colossians 3:12-13 – Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; (13) Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. </strong><br>
<br>
Have a forgiving spirit. Even as Christ forgave us; he forgave us while we were in our sins. Romans 8:5- We had the forgiveness. The word of God works for us. When our lives are in line with God. <br>
<br>
When we get our mindset and lifestyle conformed to this scripture then we are in the right relationship with Christ. <br>
<br>
When we are in the right place – we can make our requests known to God.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 13:2 – And thought I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. </strong>You can have faith but if you don&rsquo;t have love it doesn&rsquo;t profit you. Our standing in the word of God is determined by our love and faith.<br>
<br>
<strong>Philippians 3:7-8</strong> – <strong>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. (8) Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. </strong>Nothing else matters when it comes to our relationship with Christ. We must put nothing before Christ – With that understanding we must trust what God says will work in our lives, because of the promises/covenant with God.<br>
<br>
Take what God says and apply it – Never let your thoughts interfere with what God says. <br>
Sarah and Abraham had to trust in God. Abraham believed in God. He trusted in him. <br>
<br>
We as believers have circumstances that come up in our lives where we question, &ldquo;How will I do this?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not you – it&rsquo;s God. The strength comes from God. Whenever you face something that is hard remember that faith acts like it is, so even if it&rsquo;s not so, until it&rsquo;s so. <br>
<br>
It exists in the spiritual realm but it takes faith for it to be so. <strong>John 1:12</strong> <strong>– But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</strong> He gave those who received him, power. <br>
<br>
The word of God is the final. Authority, when everyone has their say – I&rsquo;m standing on the word of God.<br>
Be mindful of Satan&rsquo;s tactic to make you discouraged. We can call things that are not into existence.<br>
<br>
There&rsquo;s a difference between faith, belief and simply acknowledging something.<br>
Faith isn&rsquo;t a possession – it&rsquo;s a decision.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m going to trust in God – no matter what. We can&rsquo;t receive negativity as people of God.<br>
<br>
No matter the relationship – I can&rsquo;t be around doubtful people. <br>
<br>
Words are seeds that manifest in your life. <br>
<br>
If you profess that it won&rsquo;t get better, it won&rsquo;t. Faith works both ways. If you move from the place of believing that it will happen to doubting, it won&rsquo;t happen. <br>
<br>
Whatsoever you say, if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea, it will obey you.<br>
<br>
As Christians we persevere in faith. No one said it would be easy. Galatians 3 - Stand fast in the liberty of Christ. Don&rsquo;t go back to the old belief system. You can&rsquo;t fluctuate between the old believe system and faith. <br>
<br>
Doubt cancels out everything. Without faith it&rsquo;s impossible to please God. He&rsquo;s a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. <br>
<br>
God rewards us. There are times when issues arise in our lives. You be the first to reconcile. It blocks your blessings. You must get past it. Get on with your life.<br>
<br>
Both of us have an assignment in the kingdom. When you quarrel you are holding up God&rsquo;s work. God is not the author of confusion.<br>
<br>
If two brothers and sisters are at odds, it is our responsibility as Christians to help them reconcile to finish God&rsquo;s work. <br>
<br>
The school of faith teaches us to trust in God to solve our problems and trust in God when he decides not to solve our problems.<br>
<br>
Your way is not my way. He will never leave nor forsake us. We have promises in the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<strong>Romans 4:21</strong> <strong>– And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. </strong>All of the promises of God will be kept. He has no &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; promises. God&rsquo;s promises are as good as the real thing.<br>
<br>
<strong>Hebrews 11:39</strong> <strong>– And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise. </strong> they died in faith knowing that a heavenly promise would come to pass, but not during their lifetimes. <br>
<br>
Scripture is designed to produce faith.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>John 20:31 –But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. </strong> We serve a faithful God, it&rsquo;s a part of God&rsquo;s character to be faithful. Trust in God and his words. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 125:1 – They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</strong> When the storms of life come into your life – you need to have this verse in your spirit. <br>
<br>
Trials will come – many are the afflictions of the righteous. Remember to trust in God and in his promises. <br>
<br>
When you pray, go to the scripture and pray God&rsquo;s words back to him. When you do this, no problem can harass you. <br>
<br>
In our trouble and trials we are supposed to be the light of the world – because someone is always watching you.<br>
<br>
The enemy and his people look for us to fail. When we continue to stand, the enemy loses his mind. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 119</strong> – God needs our participation.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Ezekiel 22:30 – And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. </strong>We control our environment. <br>
<br>
You must say it with the confidence to believe what we say. <strong>1 Peter 2:9 – But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</strong> We are a royal priesthood, a holy nation, peculiar people. When God says that about me – It doesn&rsquo;t matter what others say about me.<br>
<br>
We as God&rsquo;s people have to live disciplined lives because of the distractions around us. <br>
<br>
The church has been taught for years about our unworthiness that we don&rsquo;t say what God says.<br>
<br>
Affirm your faith by verbalizing what the scripture says about us. <strong>John 16:23 – And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</strong> Ask and you shall receive. Whatever you ask for in Jesus name – will be.<br>
<br>
Walking by faith and not by sight. Put on mercy, long-suffering, forgiveness – then whatever we ask he shall give us. <br>
<br>
Power in prayer is not based on emotions but on the word of God. <br>
<br>
We don&rsquo;t win victories by being emotional. <br>
<br>
<strong>2 Corinthians 10:4</strong> – <strong> For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.</strong> Those who pray in faith will receive what they request. We must step contrary thoughts from entering our minds. Fiery darts of the wicked are contrary thoughts. The thoughts will come but you don&rsquo;t have to receive it. <br>
<br>
Never allow the image to form in your mind, especially over a long period of time.<br>
God doesn&rsquo;t have to answer immediately don&rsquo;t get discouraged when it doesn&rsquo;t come today.<br>
If he says it, it will happen. His words will not return to him empty.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> <strong>– Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.  </strong>We are already blessed. Everything in the natural world, existed first in the spiritual realm. <br>
<br>
We are chose – predestined. Prayers aren&rsquo;t based on emotions – We discipline ourselves not to become emotional when we are facing a crisis. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 27</strong> <strong>– The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? </strong>Wait on the Lord – don&rsquo;t get emotional or upset. We must praise God. <br>
<br>
<strong>Philippians 1:6 – Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. </strong> God won&rsquo;t start something that he can&rsquo;t complete.  <br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t get emotional. <strong>Galatians 5:16</strong> <strong>– This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </strong>We are children of God. We should get excited about the victory. <br>
<br>
      We have a relationship with God. Our minds need to be renewed. The enemy attacks your mind. He tries to get us to think negative and feel sorry for ourselves. He wants us to feel alone.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow negativity in. Christ is our advocate. He stands for us.<br>
  <br>
      Christ died on the cross for us but won&rsquo;t help now? He died so that we could live. Living in the kingdom isn&rsquo;t simply existing. <br>
      Speak encouraging words.<br>
  <br>
      I&rsquo;m Blessed<br>
  <br>
      My Needs are Met With Christ<br>
  <br>
      I&rsquo;m Covered<br>
  <br>
      Speak scripture into your lives.<br>
  <br>
      When you do this what&rsquo;s on the inside changes our outward appearance.<br>
  <br>
      We must pray with confidence and compassion.<br>
  <br>
      Every experience in our lives god uses it for good.<br>
  <br>
      Joseph had a rough life. Everything happened to him. <br>
  <br>
      God is preparing you for something that&rsquo;s in your future, because you have purpose.<br>
      With purpose you must pursue it. Believers must be faithful and trusting<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4: 6</strong> – <strong>Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. </strong>We make our requests and we&rsquo;re thankful when we make our requests. <br>
  <br>
      Praise should always accompany our requests.<br>
  <br>
      Lord, Thank you!<br>
  <br>
      Continue to walk by faith not by sight. <br>
  <br>
      When you start feeling down start to praise God.<br>
  <br>
      Praise eliminates the sadness. We can&rsquo;t praise God and be sad.<br>
      Keep praising him!<br>
  <br>
      Keep saying that you are blessed.<br>
  <br>
    Don&rsquo;t let anything weigh you down.</p>

      <strong>Scriptures</strong>: John 15:16, Hebrews 11:6, Philippians 4: 6-7, Psalms 84:11, 1 John 3:18, John 15:5, Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 13:2, Genesis 17:15, Genesis 17, Galatians 3:26 , 3 John 2,  Job 36:11, Matthew 5:39<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>John 15:16</strong> – You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that will last. All things are possible if you believe. Whatever you ask the father in my name, he will give you, but you first must love one another. <br>
      Faith worketh by love.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong> – Without faith it is impossible to please God. When I diligently seek after God, I receive whatever I ask. I must block out distractions; my focus must be on God.<br>
      The just shall live by faith. If you seek God for something but have disbelief, God has no pleasure in you. If you question or worry you are not trusting in God.<br>
      <br>
      When your situation deteriorates you must still stay in faith. Job had all types of troubles. He kept his faith while things continued to get worse in his life. He was covered in boils from head to toe. When his blessings came, it was greater than he could&rsquo;ve ever expected; better than he had before. <br>
      <br>
      Not believing is the equivalent of not trusting in God. Since we know that God is with us, we must discipline our mind so we don&rsquo;t do anything contrary to what God has promised. <br>
      <br>
      The will of God – Constant questioning of God&rsquo;s will, every time you pray, is the greatest hindrance to God answering your prayers. <br>
      We must be obedient.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever you ask for in prayer, you shall receive. <strong>1 John 3:18</strong> – When we keep God&rsquo;s commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight, our prayers will be answered. We have to love others and keep his commandments. God won&rsquo;t say no to those who keep his word. <br>
      <br>
      Nothing is too hard for God and nothing promised by God for his children shall be impossible. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, but <em>all things</em> must line up with his word. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Philippians 4: 6-7</strong> – Be careful for nothing. You can hold God to his word. What he says is truth and it won&rsquo;t be changed. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalms 84:11</strong> – No good thing will he withhold from those who walk upright before him. God has no respect of person. He will supply all of our needs, when we ask in faith. We have the confidence in God to say I know he will do it. I don&rsquo;t know when he will do it, but he will keep me until the prayer is answered. <br>
  <br>
      When God doesn&rsquo;t answer our prayer exactly as we asked, we must take a step back and realize that God will give us what we need.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>John 15:5 – </strong>If you abide in me and I in you ask what you will. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> – the power that Jesus has, he gives to us. We have the power to call those things that are not, as though they are. <br>
  <br>
      In <strong>Genesis 1</strong> – God said and God saw. He spoke things into existence and then he witnessed it. <br>
      <br>
      There is nothing impossible for us. You must understand the tactics of the adversary. Cast down negative thoughts and imaginations. When you are believing God for a miracle, don&rsquo;t receive negativity. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>1 Corinthians 13:2</strong> – If you don&rsquo;t have faith or love you won&rsquo;t receive the blessings of God. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Genesis 17</strong> – God has a covenant with us. He doesn&rsquo;t go back on his covenant. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Genesis 17:15</strong> – God promised Abraham that he would be the father of a multitude and Sarah the mother of many nations. <br>
  <br>
      When God sets us up for something – we can&rsquo;t substitute.<br>
      <br>
      Since we are the righteous and just, we shall live by faith. We have to maintain a certain behavior. We must walk in the spirit. <br>
      <br>
      We have to maintain the right standing with God. We are saved and filled. No man can take us from God&rsquo;s hands. There may be times when something goes wrong in your life, but your standing will not be affected. When we don&rsquo;t do what pleases God our standing doesn&rsquo;t change. He won&rsquo;t go back on his word. God won&rsquo;t change.<br>
      Our faith in Christ gave us power. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Galatians 3:26</strong> – We are all one in Christ. We are Abraham&rsquo;s seed and heirs to the throne, according to the promise.<br>
  <br>
      Never say that the Lord put something on you. He didn&rsquo;t. He came to give us an abundant life. The enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>3 John 2</strong> – Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest  prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <br>
  <br>
      There are channels through where God supplies our needs. Our job is not a source of income; it is a channel from which God uses. <br>
      <br>
      I will prosper and be in health according to my faith.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Job 36:11</strong> – If they obey him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasure. <br>
  <br>
      He forgives all iniquities and heals all diseases. We need to have confidence and also self-control. Our winning is based on our ability to control our actions.<br>
      <br>
      We need to be still and know that he is God. Be still and wait. God does what he needs to do, but we must wait. There&rsquo;s a time to move and a time to be still. <br>
      <br>
      In a multitude of words there is confusion and doubt. If our actions aren&rsquo;t controlled in one area we lose control everywhere. <br>
      We must respond well to persecution. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Matthew 5:39</strong> – turn the other cheek to persecution. This is the make-up of the disciple. Although we are going through stuff we have a calling on our lives. We have kingdom business. We&rsquo;ve already committed to God.<br>
  <br>
      Cast your cares on God and leave it. Stand in faith. Keep believing God for a miracle.<br>
      <br>
      We are blessed – we must say that constantly. Rehearse your victory. Because we are overcomers, we shouldn&rsquo;t change our speech. It should be in line with our position. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Faith acts like it is so, even when it&rsquo;s not so, so it will be so!</strong><br>
  <br>
      You are a child of God; you can bless your home and your family. There is nothing contrary to the word. We are faith filled people. We walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes there will be obstacles and distractions; don&rsquo;t let that distract you. You may have to take a detour. When you take the detour – enjoy the scenery. <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy life – get up every day with the mindset that I will enjoy the day the Lord has made. <br>
    Enjoy your life – that&rsquo;s why Jesus came. He came to give us an abundant life. </p>

      <br>
      <strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> 2 Corinthians 5:7 – For we walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
There are times when our faith is tested and we must persevere through it all. The power of your speech is significant. Get out of an old belief or mindset. There are times when we are boxed in and we put God in a box.<br>
<br>
Say it until you see it.<br>
<br>
We are people of faith. We call those things that aren&rsquo;t as though they are. John 1: 12 – To as many who have received him, we have power to be, but we must be willing to become. Since all of the promises are yes and amen, I have all that I need. When it comes to God&rsquo;s promises, we must be tough-minded. When we don&rsquo;t move from what God says it strengthens our minds. Getting tough-minded about our purpose develops our character.<br>
<br>
<strong>2 Peter 3:14</strong> – We according to his promise must be steadfast. Be diligent –Be blameless. Get out of those negative environments.<br>
<br>
As Christians, we can create an atmosphere of victory. When we create an atmosphere we get an image of victory. If you can create an image – you can change the circumstances.<br>
<br>
We create the image by meditating on the image and the word of God.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Samuel</strong> – David was not moved by what he saw. <br>
<br>
If I made it through some obstacles yesterday and I&rsquo;m faced with a new problem, I must meditate on what God did before.<br>
<br>
Just like David recalled when God delivered him from the lion and the bear he can be delivered from the Philistine. You must have the same faith. Your faith must be equal to your confession.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mark 11:23</strong> – If you believe it; you will have it. Have the faith.<br>
We must talk expectations – not experiences. Experiences are in the past – expectation is what&rsquo;s in front of me. <br>
 <br>
Don&rsquo;t dwell on the past – since greater is before you.<br>
<br>
What he promised, he will bring it to past. <br>
<br>
<strong>Proverbs 10:12</strong> – the mouth of the righteous is a well of life – you must speak life. We must guard our speech.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t allow a situation to prophesize to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 2:4</strong> – We must endure and talk expectation. Endurance is a key to walk by faith. Be not weary. Your season will show up – if you endure. You shall reap if you faint not.<br>
<br>
      Faith is not a longing for something that will come to pass. True faith is a confirmation. <br>
      <strong>Genesis 22</strong> – If you can believe all things are possible. God doesn&rsquo;t tempt us, he tests us. Abraham had the God kind of faith. He travelled with his son for 3 days without questioning God.<br>
  <br>
      The promise that God gave Abraham in Chapter 21 overrode what fear he would&rsquo;ve had.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when your faith will be tested.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when you are believing God for something, where you can&rsquo;t be in the company of doubters and disbelief. They are sowing seeds. The doubters sow into your ear gate that plants the seed or they will remind you of how what you&rsquo;re seeking God for has failed someone else.<br>
  <br>
      Be careful who you allow into your environment. When you&rsquo;re believing God for a miracle. <br>
  <br>
      Luke 8:47 – Don&rsquo;t receive what you may hear about your circumstances. Stand on the promises. Never receive anything that&rsquo;s counter-productive to the word of God. No matter the situation – trust in God.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when you must separate yourself. <strong>Matthew 6</strong> – When you pray, pray in secret and the Lord will reward you openly.<br>
  <br>
      God is the same, yesterday, today and forever. We must control our actions – be in control or it will affect you.<br>
  <br>
      Your winning hinges on your ability to control your actions.<br>
  <br>
      There is a consequence of not trusting God. Hebrews 10:38-39 – The just shall live by faith. If any man draweth back, God has not pleasure in them. We must be faith-filled people. I must believe that he is God and believe that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. <br>
      <br>
      We must give God praise – thanks but we must be careful of what else we say. Guard your speech. <br>
  <br>
      Our performance doesn&rsquo;t determine our standing in Christ, because grace keeps us.<br>
  <br>
      My standing in Christ determines my performance.<br>
  <br>
      It&rsquo;s in him that we live, move and have our being.<br>
  <br>
      They who trust in the Lord shall not be moved. When things look shaky they&rsquo;re still working out for the good. Put a smile on your face and be of good courage.<br>
  <br>
      You always move in the direction of your desire. What you do daily affects your desire. Some things we shouldn&rsquo;t watch on T.V. because it sow seeds into the spirit. Faith is the capacity to trust in God even when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense; even when you feel like the only one going through. You just keep moving.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t dwell on the negative. Our lives don&rsquo;t change until we change our thoughts. There are some areas that hinder you from seeing God&rsquo;s point of view.<br>
  <br>
      Sometimes circumstances can make you utter words that are contrary to God.<br>
  <br>
      Stand in faith – wait on the Lord – trust in God.<br>
  <br>
      The word of God will stand forever. No matter what may come.<br>
  <br>
      Reflect on your previous experiences, but don&rsquo;t let it limit you from what God can do now.<br>
    Your past mistakes shouldn&rsquo;t prevent you from future increase. Satan is an accuser. He can&rsquo;t read our mind, but he hears what we say. He listens to what we say an seeks whom he can devour. </p>
    <p>Whatever you say will come to pass. God will not violate his word. You will have whatever you say. God won&rsquo;t go against his word. Your current circumstances and other people&rsquo;s experiences limit you. You are walking in the flesh when you pay attention to the past.<br>
      <br>
      Negative limiting words – words that entice you to quit. The enemy wants to keep you from seeing God working in your life. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Deuteronomy 28</strong>: you&rsquo;re already blessed. Guard your speech. I need a blessing, counter the word of God. <br>
  <br>
      God wants us to look like us but act like him.<br>
      <br>
    Don&rsquo;t get worried; keep saying it if it doesn&rsquo;t happen tomorrow, it will happen. </p>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 28, 2014    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Preparation for Conquest</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Joshua 1:3, Hebrews 11:6, Joshua 1:8, 1 Corinthians 22:13, Isaiah 1:19, Psalm 119:15 &amp; 16, 2 Corinthians 4:7 &amp; 8, Psalm 119:112, Romans 8:38 &amp; 39, Ephesians 4:29, Ephesians 5:11, 1 Corinthians 2:14</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Joshua 1:3 – Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</strong>  </p>
    <p>We should be preparing to enter the new year at the next level. </p>
    <p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be dragging ourselves into 2015 with an &ldquo;I just made it&rdquo; attitude. You shouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with the same stuff that you dealt with in 2014.</p>
    <p>If you are dealing with the same stuff that you dealt with in January, there&rsquo;s a problem. </p>
    <p>Broken focus is the cause – set your sights on the things above where Christ sits. Don&rsquo;t worry about stuff. You should have high expectations for 2015, not worrying about the goals, plans and things that are behind.</p>
    <p>There are some things and people that you will have to let go of. Some people aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Their objective is to keep you from going somewhere. </p>
    <p>Begin todays being the person that you want to be next year – I have plans. The quality of your preparation determines the quality of your performance. </p>
    <p>You should be training your mind in the word of God. This could be the greatest year ever if you learn to trust in God without full understanding. </p>
    <p>Walk by faith!</p>
    <p>Your attitude determines your approach and your approach determines your success. </p>
    <p>How do you handle life&rsquo;s problems? What&rsquo;s your attitude toward your situation? What&rsquo;s your attitude towards others?</p>
    <p>Your attitude determines your success.</p>
    <p>Is there anything too hard for God? Then you must have the God-kind of faith. <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </strong></p>
    <p>Are you diligently seeking Christ? Get a can do attitude in your mind. What you practice is what you will ultimately become. If you practice lying, you will be a liar. If you practice stealing, you will be a thief. <br>
      <br>
      Get the image of an overcomer in your mind. Focus on the word of God. </p>
    <p>Faith without works is dead. </p>
    <p>Joshua 1:8 – meditate on the word day and night. We can&rsquo;t just take bits of scripture that we like. The bible is not a buffet table. We must meditate on the entire book.</p>
    <p>When I mediate on God&rsquo;s word I make my way prosperous. When you meditate on the word, day and night you shall be successful. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Chronicles 22:13 – Then shalt though prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes, and judgments which the Lord charged. Moses with concerning Israel; be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</strong></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re not successful because you have a lot of stuff, promotion comes from the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 1:19 – If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</strong> Be willing and obedient. </p>
    <p>God tests us by our faith and he measures us by our obedience.</p>
    <p><strong>Job 36:11 – If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</strong> All you have to do is obey and serve. We need a lifestyle of obedience. &ldquo;Lord whatever you say&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 119:15 &amp; 16 – I will meditate in they precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. (16) I will delight myself in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word. </strong></p>
    <p>We must obey God immediately. You don&rsquo;t need confirmation. Obey God joyfully. I will be happy about what God asked me to do. No excuses! I&rsquo;m going to delight myself. </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m blessed because I delight in his words. I&rsquo;m blessed because I obey and delight and meditate on your law. Early I will seek you – every morning where I rise, give me Jesus. </p>
    <p>One thing that will prevent you from receiving God&rsquo;s blessing is pressure – a lot of folks can&rsquo;t handle pressure. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 4:7-10 - But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. (8) We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair. (9) Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</strong></p>
    <p>We will be in situations but God keeps us. When you are in the storm you bend but you need to bounce back up, like a palm tree. Obey God in persecution. </p>
    <p>Speak faith-filled words when persecuted.</p>
    <p>You give your cares to Jesus. We won&rsquo;t be free from persecution. Many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivers us all. When you face persecution, you know that God will deliver you. </p>
    <p>Obey God continually – <strong>Psalm 119:112 – I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</strong> – Always. Always, I will obey God continually, without full understanding. I need to do exactly what he says. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:38 &amp; 39 – For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come (39) Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </strong></p>
    <p>When I face persecution it won&rsquo;t separate me from the love of God. Even when you are dealing with crazy people, remember that nothing will separate you from God&rsquo;s love. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch your speech – <strong>Ephesians 4:29 – Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. </strong>If you want to be successful in 2015 you need to let go of gossiping, rumors, repeating what you hear and speaking negative. Remember that silence can never be misquoted. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Be mindful of your associates – <strong>Ephesians 5:11 – And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. </strong>Who are your associates? Evil communication corrupts good manners.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Have a disciplined lifestyle – Your greatest goal in 2015 should be knowing God.    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:14 – But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </strong>Spiritual discernment the natural person doesn&rsquo;t understand spiritual discernment.<br>
      <br>
    We grow in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ. </p>

    <h1>2014 New Years Eve Service</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 31, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="fireworks.jpg" width="200" height="150"></div></p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic: </strong>New Years Eve</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 12:1-2, Proverbs 3:5, Peter 5:10</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 12:1-2 - Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, (2) Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. </strong></p>
    <p>As we come to the close of the year we are evaluating our state at the moment. What would I do differently? What changes have to be made to get to a point of change and success?</p>
    <p>Determination = Commitment</p>
    <p>I must take an inventory of my life. What did I have in 2014 that I could do without in 2015?</p>
    <p>Who do I rely on in 2015? <strong>Proverbs 3:5 - Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</strong> Trust in the Lord - some of the things in 2014 will rob you of your joy in 2015.</p>
    <p>To everything there is a season. I must make radical changes. We must put on a fresh covenant. Intolerance of your presence invokes change.</p>
    <p>Examine Yourself - What needs improvement?</p>
    <p>Let us cleanse ourselves. Don't let stuff bog you down because time is precious. This moment right here you won't get back.</p>
    <p>You can't make up for yesterday. Change the set points in your mind. If you apply worldly principles to your life, you won't ever get to where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>When others talk negative about you - remember who made you. We are his workmanship. He made us.</p>
    <p>You are capable of more than others expect, dream or imagine you to be.</p>
    <p>Your purpose will protect you from being busy but not effective. You need a plan for next year. A lot of people miss their potential because they lack a plan.</p>
    <p>Knowledge without action will overpower you.</p>
    <p>Be determined to be where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>Stop figuring out for yourself where you should go. Let God lead you to where you need to be.</p>
    <p>God wants you out of your comfort zone in 2015.</p>
    <p>Of all the things you have to with in 2015, you must first deal with yourself.</p>
    <p>Examine yourself. Prune yourself. It's hard to admit that we are the problem.</p>
    <p>Your past will keep you from where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>What didn't you accomplish in 2014?</p>
    <p>Permit unexciting dreams to die.</p>
    <p>Lay aside every wake - every sin - look at Jesus.</p>
    <p>Don't put your trust in man. Our desires are created by whatever we turn to most.</p>
    <p>Attend to God's word.</p>
    <p>The future isn't uncertain for saints of God. <strong>Peter 5:10 - But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</strong> After you suffer for a little while. You will deal with disappointment and sufferings. God never said that you wouldn't.</p>
    <p>Enjoy where you are on the way to where you're going.</p>
    <p>Enjoying life is not based on enjoyable circumstances. That's why James said to count it all joy. We must make the decision to enjoy everything. Even the little things matter.</p>
    <p>Spend quality time with God.</p>
    <p>Discipline yourself.</p>
    <p>Turn off the Television. Television is someone telling you their vision.</p>
    <p>Once you see that the world won't change, change your reaction.</p>
    <p>Life is a journey and everything in it is a process.</p>
    <p>Think outside the box.</p>
    <p>The potential to produce fruit doesn't determine if you will bear fruit or the quality of the fruit.</p>
    <p>Your assignment is not your decision. Your assignment is your discovery.</p>
    <p>Lay aside anything that robs you of your joy, peace and time.</p>

      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Understand the Real You<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures: </strong>Galatians 5:23, 2 Peter 1:3, Hosea 3:6, 2 Corinthians 2:11, 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, Jeremiah 15:16, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 1 6:8<strong></strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      Worry leads to stress which leads to diseases. A lot of people are in the hospital and sick because they are worried about what they can&rsquo;t change. <br>
      <br>
      Worry is a sin! You can&rsquo;t worry and believe God or pray a prayer of faith and worry. We must understand who we really are. <br>
      <br>
      We are spirit beings – living in this body – we have a soul.<br>
      <br>
      The soulless areas are: your mind, your will, imagination, intellect<br>
      Worry is caused by a lack of information or misinformation. Unless you&rsquo;re grounded in God&rsquo;s word, you receive untruths as truth. There are some things that may be a fact, but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the truth. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If you don&rsquo;t know the truth you&rsquo;re still in bondage. <br>
      <br>
      When you&rsquo;re in bondage you&rsquo;re unaware of what you already have. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 5:23 – Gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</strong> Peace is a fruit of the spirit. <br>
      <br>
      Perfect peace is the only peace that comes from God. You can get a semblance of peace but if it&rsquo;s not from God it&rsquo;s only a semblance of peace, not perfect peace. <br>
      <br>
      If you&rsquo;re not aware of your peace it causes us to worry. <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. </strong>He gave us all these things. Once we get to know God – We&rsquo;ll understand. We must have knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Corinthians 2:11 – In order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. </strong>The enemy has been doing this from the beginning. Unless you know the truth you&rsquo;ll believe a lie. <br>
      <br>
      We have the spirit of man and the spirit of God. We must first present our body as a living sacrifice and our minds must be transformed. <br>
      <br>
    <strong>There are 3 Types of People</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Natural Man – has no relationships with Christ. The things of God are foolish to him.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Spirit Man – Living under the control of the holy spirit and minds the things of the spirit. Led by the spirit – lower animal passions have been crucified. Galatians 2 – Not I but Christ lives in me. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Carnal Man – The carnal man is the immature Christian. Operates at a childhood level.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:1-3 – Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly – mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</strong> When you are always involved in something negative – there&rsquo;s a problem. <br>
      <br>
      To know what&rsquo;s been given to us. We must desire the sincere milk of the word.<br>
      Early will I seek thee. Early when I rise – give me Jesus. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>The instructions you follow, will determine the future you create.</strong><br>
      Develop new thought patterns. <br>
      <br>
      Your thoughts will determine your decisions, your decisions determine your action, your actions determine your habits, your habits develop your character, your character determines your destiny. <br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t work on anything else – work on your character.<br>
      <br>
      The knowledge of God brings peace, prosperity and promotion.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 15:16 – When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart&rsquo;s delight, for I bear your name, Lord God Almighty.</strong> We stand on the word. The word is a solid foundation that won&rsquo;t change.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t get anxious, concerned or tied up with the world. God is our strength and refuge. <br>
      <br>
      God has promised that he won&rsquo;t hold back anything if we walk upright.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 6:3 – We put no stumbling block in anyone&rsquo;s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</strong> Nothing can upset me. I&rsquo;m not offended! <br>
      You can&rsquo;t be offended. Get your feelings off your sleeve. You can do anything, if you&rsquo;re not offended. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Peter 1 6:8 – and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be offended by everything.<br>
  <br>
      Get virtue and knowledge. <br>
      <br>
      Get temperance.<br>
      <br>
      Discipline yourself.<br>
      <br>
      You must have self-control.</p>

          <br>
      <strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2015<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Psalm 56:13, Isaiah 43:19, Psalms 1, Isaiah 48:17, 1 Kings 8:35-36, Jeremiah 6:16, Isaiah 1:19, Galatians 5:22-23 – 22, John 1:17, Isaiah 53:6, Philippians 4:19, Galatians 2:3, Matthew 7:13-14, Hebrews 11:6, Romans 8:28, Job 42-10, Psalm 75:6-7, Job 5:17,<strong> </strong>Philippians 4:12, 2 Corinthians 1:4, Philippians 1:12, 2 Timothy 2:10, Philippians 4:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      We travel through the world with God. <strong>Psalm 56:13 – For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life</strong>. When God delivered us from sin, he didn&rsquo;t just leave us. He keeps us, watches and guides us as we go from day to day.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 43:19 – See I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. </strong>God is telling us that changes will occur in our lives. Changes occur throughout our life span. There are things that we look at and we see it as an impossibility, but God will make a way. He will put rivers in the desert. We walk in God&rsquo;s way. We walk as he instructs us to walk. We should live our lives according to scripture in order to obtain blessings. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalms 1 – Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither – whatever they do prospers. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction. </strong>We are constantly following God&rsquo;s commands and being obedient to his word. This may put you in opposition with others. God teaches us his way – he teaches us what to do and how to do. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Isaiah 48:17 – This is what the Lord says your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: &ldquo;I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.&rdquo; </strong>God teaches us to prophet. <br>
      In the workforce we do Professional Development but God teaches us to prophet – This is how we gain wisdom. God leads us in the way we should go. We must be obedient – but he won&rsquo;t make us go. <br>
      <br>
      There&rsquo;s always the temptation to do something other than what God tells you to do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 Kings 8:35-36 – When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your  name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.</strong> Another key to living a holy lifestyle. Everything we need is in place we must live up to the standards and the word of God. Holiness, humility, joy, trust, peace, and obedience. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 6:16 – This is what the Lord says: &ldquo;Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, &ldquo;We will not walk in it.&rdquo;</strong> It isn&rsquo;t an absolute must to follow God. We have free will. God tells us how to walk but he doesn&rsquo;t make us. God will allow you to go against him. <strong>Isaiah 1:19 – If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land; </strong>Having these promises – we shouldn&rsquo;t allow anything to worry us.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow your fears about  your future to distract you from what you know. When we hold on to the word – we have the fruit of the spirit – love, peace, meekness and temperance. <br>
      <br>
      Read,<strong> Galatians 5:22-23 –</strong><strong> </strong><strong>22 -&nbsp;But the fruit&nbsp;of the Spirit is love,&nbsp;joy, peace,&nbsp;forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&nbsp;23&nbsp;gentleness and self-control.&nbsp;Against such things there is no law, </strong>every time you think those thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      Saints are encouraged by repetition, revelation and studying the word. We get the answer from the word of God then verbalize the word. Put the word of the Bible into your prayers. <br>
      <br>
      The unfaithful refuse to follow God&rsquo;s way because they don&rsquo;t know. Throughout 2015, you will come into contact with people who don&rsquo;t know God, but are looking for the opportunity to know him. <strong>John 1:17 – For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. </strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 53:6 - We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. </strong>We were once there ourselves. It&rsquo;s nothing we haven&rsquo;t experienced in our lives. Jesus took on the sins of the world and the opportunity to be saved is open to us all. <br>
      God will put you in the  midst of those who need to hear. You can&rsquo;t keep silent during these times. This year will be a blessing. We are blessed. We don&rsquo;t need to look for blessings. We don&rsquo;t need to manufacture our blessings. We are blessed. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you father for supplying all of my needs. <strong>Philippians 4:19 – And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. </strong>We must pray this every morning. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 2:3 – Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</strong> Everything that we need for this life is in Christ. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ. This is where we get our knowledge. <br>
  <br>
      We don&rsquo;t need to do anything devious to be promoted. All of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We don&rsquo;t have to do anything under-handed to get ahead.<br>
      <br>
      We must obey God.<br>
      <br>
      We must live the life that Christ has laid out for us. <strong>Matthew 7:13-14- Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. (14) But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it. </strong>There are a lot of people on the wide gate that leads to destruction.<br>
      <br>
      Faith carries us there – we walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. </strong>We must have faith. We must diligently seek Christ. We can&rsquo;t just seek him for the reward. Although he is the rewarder, we seek him because he&rsquo;s our shepherd not because we want gifts.<br>
  <br>
      Everything that we experience in life, there&rsquo;s a purpose. I don&rsquo;t lose the fruits of the spirit, while I&rsquo;m going through my situation. Just know that God&rsquo;s will is working.<br>
      <br>
      There will be times this year when we go through something we must ask God to let his will be done.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</strong> It&rsquo;s working for our good. We walk by faith because our natural understanding doesn&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s working for our good. Especially when we&rsquo;ve been obedient. When you have no ill thoughts for anyone, you know that it&rsquo;s working for our good. <br>
  <br>
      Consider Job – there are times when we are dealing with something that we should never wonder why something is happening to us, a child of God. Job had to pray for his friends. <strong>Job 42-10 – After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before.</strong> He had to pray for those who misunderstood him. You have to pray for those who don&rsquo;t understand you.<br>
      <br>
      That&rsquo;s when Job&rsquo;s life turned around. The blessings is in your prayers for others. <br>
      <strong>Psalm 75:6-7 – No one from the east or west or from the desert can exalt themselves. It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</strong> Promotion comes from God. There are times when we will encounter things but <em>Romans 8</em> reminds us that we are more than conquerors. <br>
  <br>
      You&rsquo;re not going to go through life with no problems – but you must study God&rsquo;s word and develop a deeper relationship with God. He uses every experience in our life for good. He uses them to warn us or to correct us.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 119:67 – Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.</strong> God uses every experience for our good. <br>
  <br>
      We get warning from God. We just need to listen to God&rsquo;s direction. God uses our afflictions and negative experiences to make us obey his word. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Job 5:17 – Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. </strong>God corrects us. We can&rsquo;t worry about why he corrects us. Blessed is the man whom God corrects. God uses our experiences to test and exercise our trust. We must trust him. He uses situations to test us to get us to trust him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:12 – I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. </strong> When we suffer a loss, we aren&rsquo;t utterly cast down. We may lose something but we aren&rsquo;t cast down.<br>
  <br>
      God exercises our trust – he wants us to trust him more. He uses these experiences to purify us and to prepare us for glory.<br>
      <br>
      I&rsquo;m coming out of this because I have continued to do all that which is pleasing to his sight.<br>
      <br>
      There&rsquo;s a purpose for everything. Nothing happens in our lives without purpose. Sometimes we experience things that benefit other people.<br>
      <br>
      Our minds can&rsquo;t fathom God&rsquo;s plan. <strong>2 Corinthians 1:4- who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.</strong>  In our situations we are able to comfort others with the same comfort that we experienced from God. This is the life of faith. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Philippians 1:12 – Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.</strong> When things happen in our lives it&rsquo;s not for us – it&rsquo;s to help someone else. Someone else will experience the same thing that we experienced. It happened to me so that I can share with others.<br>
  <br>
      God is preparing us for the assignment that he has for us in our future. <br>
      Remember in our sharing it must all point to Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We know the way to bring peace to someone who may not know the way.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 2:10 – Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</strong> We should be thankful and trusting in all life experiences.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:12 – For I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. </strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about anything. God controls it all. Be careful for nothing. Don&rsquo;t allow contrary thoughts to come in to your mind, telling you not to ask God for something.<br>
  <br>
    Praise God in the midst of your request. </p>

    <h1>The Grace of Giving</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Grace of Giving
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image3"><img src="giving.png" width="200" height="150" alt="journey"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong> January 25, 2015<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> 2 Corinthians 9:6, 1 Corinthians 2:19, Psalm 16:4, 1 Chronicles 29, Jeremiah 17:7, Luke 6:38, 2 Chronicles 31, Galatians 6:7-8, Proverbs 3, Ecclesiastes 11:1, Proverbs 19:17<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Corinthians 9:6</strong> <strong>- But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. </strong>We are called to be disciples of Jesus Christ. With discipleship comes responsibilities. We have an assignment with the kingdom of God, so there must be a commitment. <br>
      <br>
Time, talent and treasure should be given. We own nothing. We are managers but not owners. We are only stewards. We don&rsquo;t own anything. God owns everything. Even with our children we give them back to God. We train them in the way to go so when they are old they will not depart. <br>
<br>
Giving is a command. Your giving is required to prosper in God&rsquo;s kingdom. We as God&rsquo;s people are under God&rsquo;s rule. <br>
<br>
Our mind must be transformed. The carnal mind won&rsquo;t allow you to give. The carnal mind sees everything as if it belongs to you. &ldquo;I worked for this money. It belongs to me.&rdquo; But it really belongs to God.<br>
<br>
We must move away from the world&rsquo;s system of mine, mine, mine. <br>
<br>
When we became Christians we left the world and came to God. <br>
<br>
Reception and Appreciation – we must receive the word by faith and then apply it to all areas of our lives. When I do that I become a doer of the word, not just a hearer. <br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> <strong>– What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</strong> Your body is a temple. You are not your own; you&rsquo;ve been bought with a price.<br>
<br>
Our possessions are not ours. <br>
<br>
<strong>1 Chronicles 29</strong> <strong>– But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</strong> All things come of thee and of thine own. God of yours we give back to you.<br>
<br>
The kingdom of God must be my first priority. If the kingdom of God isn&rsquo;t first, I become carnal in my thinking. I become selfish and selfish-serving. Success becomes another form of failure. We&rsquo;re never satisfied.<br>
<br>
Your tithe is your seed. It does you no good in your pocket. You can&rsquo;t reap the harvest because you have not planted the seed.<br>
<br>
We must walk in the word or we will end up somewhere we shouldn&rsquo;t be. I must trust God with my possessions as I do with my salvation.<br>
<br>
All to Jesus, I surrender. All to him I freely give. <strong>Jeremiah 17:7</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the&nbsp;Lord, and whose hope the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;is.</strong> Happy is he who trust in the Lord.<br>
<br>
<strong>Luke 6:38</strong> <strong>–</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</strong><br>
<br>
Benefits come through obedience. If you obey and serve him; you will eat the good of the land. There should be no struggling, lacking or poor saints. If you follow in his word. Let God be truth and every man, a lie. What is your attitude when you give to the kingdom?<br>
<br>
Trust in the Lord and do good; don&rsquo;t give grudgingly.<br>
<br>
If God loves a cheerful giver, what of those who grudgingly give?<br>
<br>
Once you release what&rsquo;s in your hands, what&rsquo;s in heaven will be released to you.<br>
<strong>Galatians 6:7-8</strong> <strong>– Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</strong> You will reap what you sow. You must sow bountifully. Giving should be a persistent joy to give.<br>
<br>
Every opposition against giving should be cast down.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t become prideful about materials. When you become prideful about your possessions they become your God.<br>
<br>
Your abilities aren&rsquo;t responsible for what you have. <br>
<br>
Every check given to you is from God. It must come into his storehouse.<br>
<br>
You can&rsquo;t give your tithes to anyone. When you do something else with your tithes, you&rsquo;re stealing from God. <strong>Proverbs 3</strong> – trust in the Lord. Your seed is the only influence you have over your future.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ecclesiastes 11:1</strong>- <strong>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</strong> The seed that leaves you hand, never leaves your life. It enters your future and it multiplies.<br>
<br>
When we sow a seed we agree with God&rsquo;s word that it will increase in our life.<br>
<br>
We must wait for it to grow.<br>
<br>
When God blesses us we must remember the poor.<br>
<br>
Our outward circumstances shouldn&rsquo;t inhibit our giving.<br>
<br>
When pleasing God is our goal, God will flood our lives with the blessing. <br>
<br>
  <strong>Proverbs 19:17 – He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</strong></p>

    <h1>Obedience and Discipline </h1>

    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 John 2 4:5, Proverbs 12:22, 1 Timothy 2:4, Matthew 14:18, Matthew 22, Isaiah 5:14, 1 Thessalonians 5:18, Psalm 104, 1 Thessalonians 4:7, 1 Peter 1:15,  1 Peter 2:15, 1 Peter 3:17, Peter 4:19<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      God&rsquo;s will is revealed in his word. <strong>1 John 2 4:5</strong> – When we obey God&rsquo;s word we know that we are in him. The fulfillment of the word comes from Christ. <br>
      <br>
      We must be obedient to the word of God. God&rsquo;s will for the world is justice and righteousness. He desires honesty and truth. We can&rsquo;t lie or verbalize untruth with each other or with God.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Proverbs 12:22</strong> – God desires honesty and truth. God delights in our honesty and when we are truthful with each other. Sometimes we withhold truth because we don&rsquo;t want to hurt feelings but by not verbalize the truth we end up hurting them more in the end. <br>
      <br>
      Especially, neighbors, friends and relatives who aren&rsquo;t saved. It&rsquo;s God will for the world to be saved.<br>
      <br>
      We must be a witness to others so they will know the truth. <strong>1 Timothy 2:4</strong> – God wants everyone to be saved. Even the worst of us. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Matthew 14:18</strong> – God doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to be lost. God&rsquo;s will for us loving obedience. <strong>Matthew 22</strong> – I must obey God without full understanding.<br>
      I must be obedient to God even if it causes opposition with  my closest associates. We must obey. Joshua – as for me and my house, it&rsquo;s my responsibility to bring it in line to the will of God. The man is the head of the house.<br>
      <br>
      Not only do we have instruction, our husbands do too. Husbands shouldn&rsquo;t go outside of God&rsquo;s will, wives don&rsquo;t go beyond their husbands. <br>
      <br>
      Scripture makes obeying God the highest priority over performing religious acts. Obeying God takes precedence over serving on church boards.<br>
      <br>
      God desires us to be willing and obedient. <strong>Isaiah 5:14</strong> – There are situations where you are willing but not obedient.<br>
      <br>
      God grants us mercy so we must in turn show mercy. God forgives us so we must forgive others because one time or another we&rsquo;ll need God&rsquo;s forgiveness.<br>
      There should never be a time when you are in the midst of worship and not be ready to bless the name of the Lord.  <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:18</strong> – in everything give thanks, not for everything give thanks. <br>
      <br>
      It could&rsquo;ve been worse – thank you Lord for saving/keeping me. Even in the worse of situations you said that all things would work for the good. Even when we don&rsquo;t see it, we must know that it&rsquo;s working for our good. All we have to do is discipline ourselves to wait on when it will manifest.<br>
      <br>
      We also can&rsquo;t set time limits. We must know that he promised it and he will keep us until it comes to pass. <strong>Psalm 104</strong> – Now with this knowledge I can bless his name. You need to praise him, just because you are still alive. Whatever you are dealing with there is someone else worse off than you. He wont put more on you than you can bear.<br>
      <br>
      God desires us to worship him – He inhabits the praise of his people. The more you praise him, the better you&rsquo;ll feel. You can praise your way through and out of situations. <br>
      <br>
      We know what he promised. He desires us to worship and be holy. <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:7 </strong>– He called us to be holy. We must walk upright before him and be holy.<br>
      <br>
      We must discipline ourselves to be holy. We need this lifestyle so we may let our light shine. When people see you they must see a Godly person. People want to know Jesus. <strong>1 Peter 1:15 </strong>– In everything we do we must watch our speech. We must watch the conversations that we&rsquo;re involve in. Don&rsquo;t join in unholy conversations. You&rsquo;re adding fuel to the fire.<br>
      <br>
      You must discipline yourself not to listen to gossip. God calls us to love each other. God didn&rsquo;t say, that the person we&rsquo;re supposed to love should behave a certain way. We must still show love. <br>
      <br>
      John 15: - - We must be willing to give the ultimate sacrifice. God desires that we have a high moral standard. Some things we shouldn&rsquo;t be involved in <strong>1 Peter 2:15</strong> – People will try to involve you in their foolishness. We must do what God tells us to do.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes abiding by God&rsquo;s will involves suffering. We are not in this life to be free from suffering. God doesn&rsquo;t give you anything to get your attention. He can get your attention if he wants to. <br>
      <br>
      There are times where it involves suffering.<strong> 1 Peter 3:17</strong> – The will of God. If you suffer for well doing, Christ is glorified (1 Peter 3:17) Don&rsquo;t despise the chastening of the Lord. Don&rsquo;t get bent out of shape when we&rsquo;re chastened. 1 <strong>Peter 4:19</strong> – If I suffer according to his will, I commit my soul to God.</p>

    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 10:10, John 6:63, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:3, Genesis 1, John 17:8, Mark 9:23, Mark 11:22, Hebrews 11:6, 2 Peter 1:3, Psalm 84:11 – 12, 2 Corinthians 1:20, Joshua 1:8, Psalm 34:9, Ephesians 3:9, 2 Chronicles 4:7, Romans 8:12<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper. This is a promise from God. When our lives line up with the word of God we can access and receive prosperity and health. <br>
    <br>
    God has called us to holiness and righteousness. Above all things God heals us of our sickness and diseases. Even as our soul prosper our inner mind, thoughts and hearts must be transformed. <br>
    <br>
    In order to prosper we must obey God&rsquo;s will. Whatever it takes, I must obey God without full understanding. <br>
    <br>
    Walk by faith not by sight. When I walk by faith and not by sight, I&rsquo;m not distracted by the negative going on around me. I must obey God.<br>
    <br>
    Changes will occur in our lives but we can&rsquo;t move away from the word. Faith is important because we are a people of faith.<br>
    <br>
    We can&rsquo;t talk about faith without talking about spiritual warfare. Everything to leading a life of Godliness is in the word of God. God has given me his best. I&rsquo;m not going to accept second best.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>John 10:10 – The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</strong> Whatever level of life we are at; there is another level out there for us because Christ came so we could have abundant life. We become more loving and more spiritual. We are able to withstand more. When we are in places where we are under pressure we must remember that we are victorious.<br>
    Keep the mindset that you are victorious. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>John 6:63 –</strong> <strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</strong> God&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. We take God&rsquo;s words and speak those words into whatever situation we are in.<br>
  <br>
    Depending on the situation, take the scripture and put it on your life. When you are studying the word of God, read it so you can hear it because faith comes by hearing.<br>
    <br>
    When I speak the word into the spirit man takes control over the carnal man.<br>
    Speak the word boldly. <br>
    <br>
    We are blessed right now. Every resource needed for Godly living we have right now – because God gave us his life. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.</strong> Don&rsquo;t become discouraged when you are dealing with a situation that won&rsquo;t seem to change. Speak the word of God into the situation and believe it will change. <br>
  <br>
    The word of God will not fail. In order to receive what God has given to us, we need the knowledge of God.<br>
    <br>
    Since the mouth of the righteous is a well of life, we must train our speech so we don&rsquo;t contradict what God has said. You can&rsquo;t say that it won&rsquo;t get better. This contaminates your faith.<br>
    <br>
    We walk by faith and not by sight, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter how it looks. Situations and circumstances create pressure. You will have to endure pressure. How can you handle the alone times?<br>
    <br>
    The best time to meditate and speak the word into your situation is when you&rsquo;re alone. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1</strong> – God gave us the key to operate in a spiritual life. God said, God said then God saw. We must keep saying it until we see it.<br>
  <br>
    We have the assurance that we will prosper and be in health, but the assurance comes from God.<br>
    <br>
    We must pay careful attention to what we say because your words are spirit and life. Death and life are in the power of the tongue.<br>
    <br>
    We have the assurance because of God&rsquo;s word. <strong>John 17:8</strong> <strong>– For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</strong> This is the faith part. We believe that the word of God is true. We believe that we are blessed. <br>
    <br>
    My belief in being blessed isn&rsquo;t predicated on me having stuff. I believe it by what I know, not by what I see. I have the assurance because of God&rsquo;s oath and his promises to us.<br>
    <br>
    The words know, known and knowledge are written 1400 times, in the bible. The idea is centered around knowing God. Knowing God, I have the assurance. <br>
    <strong>Mark 9:23</strong> <strong>– Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</strong>All you have to do is believe. Take the verse literally. All things are possible to them that believe. No matter the situation, if I believe with unwavering faith, God will supply my needs. We must not allow doubt to creep in. <strong>Mark 11:22</strong> <strong>– And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</strong> Have faith in God. Don&rsquo;t doubt believe. <br>
  <br>
    The words that I speak out of my mouth, I will have. Words are powerful.<br>
    <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong> <strong>– But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> Without faith it is impossible to please God. When I approach circumstances I must speak faith filled words.<br>
  <br>
    When God says whosoever he meant any and everyone.<br>
    <br>
    I believe what I say will come to pass. <br>
    <br>
    It is already in place in the heavenly realm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong> – <strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.</strong> We already have the good things. We must control our speech, flesh and minds. God shows us what&rsquo;s good in the word so we can&rsquo;t get caught up in the world. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalm 84:11 – 12</strong> – <strong>For the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> God is a sun and shield: the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 12&nbsp;O </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</strong>
    <p>If I&rsquo;m trusting in God, I&rsquo;m blessed. He&rsquo;s not going to withhold anything good. He love us so much that some things that we want aren&rsquo;t good for us and he withholds it. He protects us because of his covenant with us. God guides and protects us from bad things.   <br>
      <br>
      There are times when we don&rsquo;t fulfill the love of the spirit, we follow our flesh, so God withholds it from us. <br>
      <br>
      We should be grateful. God does more than give to us. He&rsquo;s our keeper, protector and guide. We must stay in faith. All things are given to those who believe. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 1:20 – For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. </strong>All of the promises of God are yes and Amen.<br>
  <br>
      There must be reception and application <strong>Joshua 1:8 – This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>We must meditate on the word of God day and night. <strong>Psalm 34:9</strong> <strong>– O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</strong> We need to have reverence for God. God already said that there is no want to them who fear the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      There will be times where you may not have the bible in your hands but you must meditate on the word in your heart. <br>
      <br>
      That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to be lead by the spirit so you don&rsquo;t fulfill the lust of the flesh.<br>
      <br>
      There are things that look pleasing to the eyes but aren&rsquo;t good for us. God loves us to much that he protects us from our own wants and decisions. The aim of the Lord isn&rsquo;t short so he cannot save. God saves us everyday. There are situations that he saves us from that would&rsquo;ve otherwise been devastating. Have the spirit of faith.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Ephesians 3:9</strong> <strong>– And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.</strong> God has opened it up so that the body of Christ will know God.<br>
  <br>
      We must stay in Christ – no matter what happens in the world. We have the ability to bring about change. <strong>2 Chronicles 4:7</strong> <strong>– And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</strong> We have it, we must remain faithful to the calling.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Romans 8:12</strong> <strong>– Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</strong> We don&rsquo;t owe this flesh anything. Brethren – saints he&rsquo;s talking to the saints. We must remember that not everyone in the church will be lead by the spirit.<br>
  <br>
      That&rsquo;s why when Christ returns he will start with the church. When people don&rsquo;t walk by the word we show forth the love of Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We have the assignment to save those who are loss.<br>
      <br>
      You don&rsquo;t have to be a preacher to share the good news. We have to share the word. <br>
      <br>
    It&rsquo;s not our performance, it&rsquo;s what God does thru us.  </p>

    <h1>Where is Your Faith?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 1, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image6"><img src="mountains.png" width="200" height="118" alt="journey"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Where is your faith?</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 3:6, Hebrews 11:6, John 6:63, Daniel 3:27, 1 Corinthians 2:10, Galatians 3:6, James 2:14, 1 Corinthians 10:13, Matthew 17:20, Mark 9:23, Matthew 7:7, Psalm 84:11, Psalm 34:10, Philippians 4:5-6, Philippians 4:13, Isaiah 26:3, Romans 8:16-17, Mark 11:23</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Nothing will happen in your life until you use your faith. <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – </strong><strong>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> Without faith it is impossible to please God.</p>
    <p>Time does not decide our miracles; faith does. Your victory will only be realized in a renewed mind. </p>
    <p>We must discipline our thoughts and our minds. Productivity takes place in your mind before it becomes evident in your life. To get to this point we must have the God kind of faith.</p>
    <p>What you say in the midst of your circumstances determines how long you will be in it. </p>
    <p>Words are powerful <strong>John 6:63 – </strong><strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</strong> We speak the word of God into our situations. <br>
      Because we are born again believers our greatest opportunities sometimes come disguised as a problem. Don&rsquo;t view every problem as a problem. It may look like a wall in front of you, but really it&rsquo;s a door. It looks like an obstacle but really it&rsquo;s a stepping stone. </p>
    <p><strong>Daniel 3:27 – </strong><strong>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</strong> When they came out of the furnace there was no evidence that they were there. You should be able to go through problems without others knowing what you&rsquo;re going through. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:10 – </strong><strong>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</strong>  All of God promises are yes and amen. </p>
    <p>When God called Abraham where he was, he had to remove him from his father&rsquo;s house because Abraham&rsquo;s parents were idol worshippers. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 3:6 – </strong><strong>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</strong> They that are of faith are the same as Abraham&rsquo;s children. Whatever you&rsquo;re dealing with you must get into the word and quote the promise of God into your situation. </p>
    <p>We must challenge our ability. Your ability needs responsibility to expose the possibilities. </p>
    <p><strong>James 2:14 – </strong><strong>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</strong> Faith without works is dead. We walk by faith and not by sight. You must discipline your belief system. If you&rsquo;re not careful your mind will wander. We don&rsquo;t see with our eyes, we see through our eyes. <br>
      Without faith, what you see determines how you will respond.<br>
      See problems as opportunities.<br>
  <br>
      There is no excuse for disobeying God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 10:13 – </strong><strong>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</strong> Whatever you are dealing with, there is a way of escape.</p>
    <p>The attributes of God and the restored faculty of man, can be brought into existence, things that are not.<br>
       <br>
  <strong>Matthew 17:20 – </strong><strong>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</strong>  Nothing will be impossible if you have the faith, the size of a mustard seed.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark 9:23 – </strong><strong>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</strong> <em>Believe </em></p>
    <p>Faith acts like it&rsquo;s so, even when it&rsquo;s not so, that it may be so. </p>
    <p>Your words set the stage for your life. There may be times where it gets worse before it gets better. <strong>Matthew 7:7 – </strong><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</strong> Have the faith and believe.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 84:11 – </strong><strong>For the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> God is a sun and shield: the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</strong> No good thing will I withhold from you</p>
    <p>Have faith and do the right thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 34:10 – </strong><strong>The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> shall not want any good thing.</strong> Ask in faith and do right. We have to come to God with the right attitude towards God and each other. They that seek the Lord will not want any good thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:5-6 </strong><strong>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</strong><strong> 6 </strong><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Moderation = meekness, mildness, patience, kindness and gentleness to all men. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:13 – </strong><strong>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong> I can let my moderation be known to all men, no matter how they behave; because we can do all things.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 26:3 – </strong><strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:16-17 </strong>– The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>
    <p><br>
      You can prosper and be in health, but we need the right attitude.</p>
    <p>Talk expectations, not experiences.</p>
    <p>When you speak about negativity, you rehearse defeat.</p>
    <p>Have faith in God.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark 11:23 </strong>– the power of speech.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever you desire – when you pray believe and you shall receive those things.</p>
    <p>Pray the scripture back to God.</p>
    <p>Remember when you pray, Forgive!</p>

    <h1> How to Overcome False Beliefs</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 4, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image7"><img src="roses.png" width="200" height="133"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> How to Overcome False Beliefs</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 10:22, Hebrews 13:5, Hebrews 13:6, 1 John 5:14, 1 John 3:21, Psalm 27:14, Galatians 5:16, 1 Kings 3:13, Matthew 7:24, Hebrews 10:38-39, Galatians 1:6, Galatians 4:8    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>We have the assurance by God that he will do what he says he will do. The just shall live by faith. Faith is our lifestyle and foundation.</p>
    <p>Complete conviction and confidence are required. This is how we live our lives. We must overcome false belief. </p>
    <p>We have to learn how to cooperate with the plan of God in order to see our purpose. </p>
    <p>We must do what&rsquo;s pleasing in his sight.</p>
    <p>Assurance and faith are connected. <strong>Hebrews 10:22 – Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</strong> Every born again believer has a measure of faith. God-kind of faith means no matter what I see, hear or endure my faith is in God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p><strong>Cast aside doubt. </strong></p>
    <p>Go to God&rsquo;s word and say the word of God to any situation. </p>
    <p>Scriptures connect. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. </p>
    <p>The key is not to allow the thoughts of doubt, disbelief and fear to come in because they cancel out your faith.</p>
    <p>Doubt moves you away from your position in faith. If you make a faith confession – never go back and say something counter productive to what you said. </p>
    <p>We must have an assurance in adversity. <strong>Hebrews 13:6 –</strong> <strong>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</strong> If you look at, <strong>Hebrews 13:5 (Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.),</strong> it&rsquo;s the key to <strong>Hebrews 13:6. </strong></p>
    <p>When I&rsquo;m seeking a blessing, I can&rsquo;t allow myself to look at anyone else and covet what they have. <br>
      <br>
      The word of God has already told me that he can do above and abundantly more than what you want. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fear man or adversity. Fear is counterproductive to having faith. Jesus says to us not to worry. All of his promises are yes and amen. <br>
      <br>
      We have that assurance and we need the assurance; that we receive what we request, when we pray.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 5:14 – </strong><strong>And</strong><strong> this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</strong> Confidence and assurance in Christ. If we ask anything in his will, he will hear us. </p>
    <p>When you request from God you must keep in mind how your actions affect others. If what you request has a negative impact on others, you may not receive it. Have assurance in prayer. <strong>1 John 3:21 – Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</strong> We have assurance, we make our requests known, but we must keep his commandments and do what&rsquo;s pleasing to God; especially in relation to others. </p>
    <p>The assurance comes through our understanding of who God is. We must have the assurance that there will be periods where we have to wait. <strong>Psalm 27:14 – Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.</strong> While you wait maintain a good character. Don&rsquo;t get frustrated. </p>
    <p>We will have to make radical changes to do the will of God. There are times where the changes you have to make aren&rsquo;t comfortable, but I must please God, not man.</p>
    <p>Pray, seek God, walk in holiness and make radical changes. <strong>Galatians 5:16 – This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</strong> Making changes to do God&rsquo;s will requires a lifestyle that doesn&rsquo;t allow flesh and emotions to enter into our decision-making.</p>
    <p>In all our ways acknowledge him. </p>
    <p>We must obey God without full understanding. I don&rsquo;t need for God to make everything planned. </p>
    <p>Whatever God says he means. We must obey God. Obedience and love are closely connected. If you are obedient, you love.</p>
    <p>I must submit to God and to the authorities on the earthly realms. At work, you must submit yourself to authority.</p>
    <p>Christ learned obedience. Obedience and faith go together. When we obey God  - there is a reward for obedience. <strong>1 Kings 3:13</strong> <strong>– And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</strong> Walk thy way to keep they statutes – lengthen your days. </p>
    <p>Faith in God will lead you to a good old age. When you keep his commandments and honor God we don&rsquo;t do anything harmful to our bodies. We must receive what Jesus gives. We must obey God&rsquo;s word. <strong>Matthew 7:24 – Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.</strong></p>
    <p>Obey God&rsquo;s word if you want to overcome obstacles in your life. Obey his word and when the wind, rain and floods come we won&rsquo;t be washed away. Just because we&rsquo;re people of God doesn&rsquo;t mean that the flood won&rsquo;t come, it means that when the floods do come, we will be able to stand them.</p>
    <p>We must line this life of faith based on God&rsquo;s words. God teaches us the way.</p>
    <p>All other routes will end in death, if it&rsquo;s not the will of God. When we live our lives according to God&rsquo;s commandments we have the victory.</p>
    <p>Discipline yourself. Faith comes by hearing, but so can false doctrine. Be careful what you hear and what you say. Be quick to hear and slow to speak. <br>
      <br>
      Since faith comes by hearing we have to be mindful of what we hear and say. When we face trials – go to God&rsquo;s word. <br>
  <br>
      We are blessed but when we stay with God&rsquo;s word, we learn how to live.<br>
  <br>
      Be careful how you relate to coworkers, friends, family and the church congregation, this leads to prosperity. Those who travel God&rsquo;s way are blessed. <br>
  <br>
      Doubt and murmuring are traps.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow that to trap you. We must love each other, pray for each other and go into God&rsquo;s word. All our choices give an indication of who we decide to be. If you&rsquo;re not careful you make the wrong choice, consider what you&rsquo;re dong. Is this what God wants me to do? </p>
    <p>We are blessed, abundantly blessed. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 10:38-39 - Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</strong> <strong>39</strong> <strong>But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</strong> You see the consequence in not living by faith. If you are living by faith, you can&rsquo;t be a backslider. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 1:6 – I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel.</strong></p>
    <p>Our calling is very serious. If we stop we&rsquo;re not fit for the kingdom.</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 4:8 -  Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</strong> Before we were saved we had faith in things that weren&rsquo;t Godly. Once we walk by faith, to turn away puts us back in bondage. Being in bondage means that you are yielding to your flesh.</p>
    <p>We were delivered; we don&rsquo;t go back to bondage. Now we walk in holiness and righteousness. </p>
    <p>You can get into a backsliding position and end up in trouble. </p>
    <p>Walking by faith is key to our salvation, faith in Christ and blessings. We must not have faith and then put it on hold. </p>
    <p>The biggest deception is to think that you did it on your own. The flesh has a yearning to do all the things it used to before you were saved. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to know God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p>So instead of adversity taking you back to that place, it should draw you closer to God.  </p>

  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong><span class="ui-li-aside"><img src="waterfallcascade.png" width="175" height="117" alt="Fire the Flesh"></span>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 8, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Fire the Flesh</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 5:16, Ephesians 1:3, Galatians 5:22-23, John 16, Romans 8:12-14, Proverbs 23:20, 1 Corinthians 9:27, Joshua 1:8, 1 John 4:1, Psalm 18:32, Proverbs 28:6, 1 Corinthians 15:33, </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 5:16 – This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</strong> You have to fire the flesh. The lifestyle of a believer. What do we look like to the world? A kingdom lifestyle can only be achieved when we use the power to live holy. The power to live holy is the work of the holy spirit. When people receive God at that very moment the holy spirit takes residence in their lives.</p>
    <p>He shall teach you all things and bring all things to our remembrance. We as saints of God have power. </p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t use the power, but we have it. Consider a new car with a speedometer of 180 but the driver never goes above 30 miles per hour. You have the power; why not use it.<br>
      <br>
      When we are not walking in the spirit we will fulfill the lust of the flesh. Bad attitudes and weird thoughts indicate that you are not walking in the spirit. </p>
    <p>There is no defeat when you are walking in the spirit. We can overcome any obstacle or temptation. When we are lead by the spirit all of heaven is at our disposal. <strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> <strong>– Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. </strong>Heaven is at our disposal. </p>
    <p>Walk in divine health.</p>
    <p>Our understanding of healing is far below God&rsquo;s ways. Our ways aren&rsquo;t his ways. Don&rsquo;t worry about things. When you ask God for it, be willing to accept the answer. God answers our prayers, just not in the manner that you may want it to be answered.</p>
    <p>When we receive God we receive the fruit of the spirit. <strong>Galatians 5:22-23 – But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, (23) </strong><strong>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</strong> When I&rsquo;m lead by the spirit my attitude, speech and actions demonstrate my willingness to do God&rsquo;s will and to do it immediately. </p>
    <p>We must obey God immediately because the scripture says that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. We must take delight in the agreement with God&rsquo;s law. We must meditate on the law of God.</p>
    <p>We must love the word of God. </p>
    <p>1st step is walking in the spirit – be aware of the conflicts that you&rsquo;re involved in. Negative thoughts that are nourished will produce a stronghold in your mind. Submit yourself to God – resist the devil and he will flee. This demonstrates the power that we have. </p>
    <p>We have been called to liberty. We are free. Don&rsquo;t use the freedom to do crazy things. Just because you&rsquo;re saved doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can do what you want. <br>
      <br>
      Fire the flesh. The word doesn&rsquo;t work for the carnal Christian. </p>
    <p><strong>Jeremiah 17:5</strong> – <strong>Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.</strong> You must understand the real you in Christ. Don&rsquo;t trust another man. Trust God. </p>
    <p>The real you. <strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> – <strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</strong> Your body is the temple of the holy ghost. We can&rsquo;t do whatever we want. <strong>Romans 8:12</strong> – <strong>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</strong> If you live after the flesh, you are spiritually dead. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:12-14</strong> – to walk in the spirit we need restraints. Flesh is always lusting after something. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Proverbs 23:20</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh.</strong> When someone&rsquo;s lifestyle isn&rsquo;t according to the spirit you can&rsquo;t mix with them. Whenever you spend time with them you lose your light. As saints of God, who&rsquo;ve received the power of the spirit, why do you keep going back to what you did before you were saved?</p>
    <p>Whatever you did before you were saved is still in the flesh. That&rsquo;s why some people can be in worship and praise God all day long, but if you cut them off on the road or dent their vehicle in the parking lot, another person will show up.</p>
    <p>Carnal Christians can shift. We need restrains. <strong>1 Corinthians 9:27</strong> <strong>– But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</strong> We must be disciplined – control the flesh.</p>
    <p>You need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Revelation</li>
      <li>Role model</li>
      <li>Righteous resolve without full understanding<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A student of the scripture is always learning. <strong>Joshua 1:8</strong> <strong>– This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>We can&rsquo;t treat the word of God like a buffet table. We must take the whole law of the Lord.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> <strong>– Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</strong> We need a spirit of discernment. </p>
    <p>Everybody with a robe is not preaching the gospel. You must know the word of God. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t just take anything. </p>
    <p>Be spiritually mature – we are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God. Early will I seek thee. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow anything to get in the way of your time with God.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 18:32 –</strong> <strong>It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</strong> God arms me with strength.</p>
    <p>Overcome temptations because temptation will come. </p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t go thinking we did it on our own. Don&rsquo;t be puffed up; this is a prime candidate for failure. <br>
      <br>
      With every temptation – remember that God is faithful. </p>
    <p>We need a spirit of discernment in order to make moral decisions. </p>
    <p>Will this put me in immoral company? You can&rsquo;t please everybody. You can&rsquo;t make people do anything that they don&rsquo;t want to do. You can share the truth with them, but they will do what they want. </p>
    <p>Commit it to the Lord. You don&rsquo;t have to go back and check to see how God is doing while he is working on your problems. You don&rsquo;t need to set the parameters for God.</p>
    <p>Though he slay me yet will I trust thee. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:33 – Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</strong> Be mindful of what you say. </p>
    <p>Does this violate my conscious?  We secure spiritual maturity by putting away childish things. </p>
    <p><em>You have the victory right now. You&rsquo;re an overcomer right now!</em></p>
    <p>Obey God, continually, joyfully and immediately.<br>
      <br>
      There are things that God will allow in your life that you don&rsquo;t like, but you have been ordained to fix.<br>
  <br>
      What you hate, you&rsquo;ve been sent to correct. </p>
    <p>When Jesus says we are the light of the world, we must be the light!  </p>

    <p><strong>Date: </strong>February 11, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> How to be content<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> Philippians 4:11<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Philippians 4:11, Matthew 17:20, Philippians 3:17 – 18, Philippians 3:19, Philippians 4:11, Philippians 4:6-7, Colossians 3:15, 2 Corinthians 10, Romans 8:28, Philippians 4:11, Philippians 4:8, 1 Peter 5:6-7, Colossians 3:1<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Philippians 4:11 – I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</strong> The secrets to the cure of worry. Meditate on scripture to overcome worry. Worrying doesn&rsquo;t solve anything in our lives. <br>
      <br>
      We have overcome the world. We can&rsquo;t define contentment apart from the behavior it produces. Some live in denial. Denial will always reject correction. Get out of denial.<br>
      You can&rsquo;t correct a problem if you&rsquo;re in denial. When you condone other bad behavior you&rsquo;re in denial as well. We arrive at the place of contentment by making a decision, become established in the decision and meditate on it. Confessing God&rsquo;s word gives us the power to change our focus. <br>
      <br>
      Faith coupled with confession empowers believers. <strong>Matthew 17:20 – He replied, &ldquo;Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&rdquo;</strong> We enter into this area of having faith with this scripture in mind. Making a faith confession and I won&rsquo;t be moved by circumstances and situations in my life. I&rsquo;m going to meditate on the word of God day and night.<br>
      <br>
      I&rsquo;m not going to speak about my circumstances. I&rsquo;m going to talk about the answer. If I keep talking about the problem, I&rsquo;m giving life to the problem, not to the word of God. <br>
      Never allow your circumstances to create the vision for you. Don&rsquo;t allow your problems to prophesize to you. <br>
      <br>
      When I do that I move out of the place of contentment. It requires a disciplined effort. The thoughts, emotions and actions of the flesh will have you investing in everything else, but the word of God.<br>
    <strong>There are 5 things that will pull you from your place of contentment:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Problems – If I&rsquo;m focusing on the problem, I&rsquo;m not focusing on the answer.</li>
      <li>Persecution – comes to discourage you and try to get you to give up.</li>
      <li>Passions – threatens the focus of your faith. If we allow them to become dominant in our lives it threatens our focus and purpose. It threatens how we function and how we respond to things.</li>
      <li>Pleasures that lead to sinful distractions – there are pleasures that aren&rsquo;t sinful but our participation in it leads to sinful distractions.  </li>
      <li>Situations, circumstances and associates – those who are not living godly lives aren&rsquo;t good for us because those relationships lead to sinful distractions.<strong> Philippians 3:17 – 18 – Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 18&nbsp;For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</strong> They only want to satisfy their flesh. Their minds aren&rsquo;t on living godly lives. <strong>Philippians 3:19 – Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.</strong> We should mark them and live godly lives before them to that I can continue to let my light shine. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t participate in it, no matter what it is. It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t have a relationship with them, we must set an example. <br>
      <br>
      If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can be in the spirit of contentment and relapse back into the old lifestyle. You must discipline yourself. When relapses occur, we forget about the price that was paid for us. Christ died for us. He suffered and died for us.<br>
      <br>
      Relapse occurs when we forget the misery and pain that occurred before we were saved. The old life has no joy, peace or contentment. You don&rsquo;t want to relive that. If I forget about that completely, relapse will occur. <br>
      <br>
      When we think we can live independent of God&rsquo;s word, we deceive ourselves. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:11</strong> <strong>– I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</strong> Contentment is a learned procedure. It&rsquo;s not automatic. We learn to be content through the daily problems and situations in life. It must be taught. <br>
  <br>
      When we are content – we won&rsquo;t be covetous. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what everyone else has. We don&rsquo;t covet that. <br>
      <br>
      When I&rsquo;m content – I won&rsquo;t be tested to be competitive with my brothers and sisters. If you get something new I&rsquo;m not envious or jealous. <br>
      <br>
      Before salvation we received information about what&rsquo;s right and wrong. You must ask yourself the question of who did you receive the understanding of who you are? What was their motive in telling you who you were?<br>
      <br>
      Some who tell you who you are, don&rsquo;t know who they are because they follow the worlds standards. That says in order to be important you need stuff (cars, houses) It&rsquo;s false though, because you can have all of the stuff in the world, and not be content.<br>
      <br>
      To whoever you surrender the right to define who you are, controls your destiny. They will define who you are and what you can do.<br>
      <br>
      You must know who you are. Knowing who you are gives you the keys to the kingdom. <br>
      <br>
      God made us and it&rsquo;s up to God to define how we function in life. We have a purpose – for every purpose there&rsquo;s an assignment. In order to get to contentment we must take the definition of our worth and value out of the hands of people. <br>
      <br>
    People may think they know you but they don&rsquo;t really know you. God has a plan for us.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Cure to worry:</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Philippians 4:6-7 – Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. </strong>Verse 6 is a command. Just like though shalt not…In order to get to that place of being careful for nothing, I must be content. In everything I must pray. From the smallest issue to the serious, I must pray. I can&rsquo;t worry because it solves nothing. If you worry you are borrowing troubles that can&rsquo;t be paid back. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Worrying is sinful – worry produces fear which is counter-productive  to the word of God. Every time you worry – verbalize the scripture. <strong>Philippians 4:7 - And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</strong>. Peace of God – in verse 6 we see the command – verse 7 we see the promise. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Colossians 3:15 – And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</strong> Let the peace of God rule in your heart. This verse tells us that the peace of God ruling in our heart is a choice. It is up to me. If I&rsquo;m worrying – I&rsquo;m not letting the peace of God rule. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m focusing on the problem if I&rsquo;m worrying. Renounce all worry by thanksgiving. Let your requests be known. </p>
    <p>Set your mind to be content. As a man thinketh, so is he. </p>
    <p>When the thoughts come, use your spiritual weapon. <strong>2 Corinthians 10 – (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</strong> - you have a weapon.</p>
    <p>We must stand on the word. Since this is a spiritual battle going on. It&rsquo;s a war between flesh and spirit. Circumstances and situations want you to worry and focus only on it. </p>
    <p>Our weapons aren&rsquo;t carnal. Worry, if you allow it to be a focus it will build a stronghold in your life. Tormenting over something that will likely be a blessing if it comes. There are times when blessings come disguised as a problem.<br>
      <br>
      It may look, feel and smell like a problem, but <strong>Romans 8:28 - And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</strong></p>
    <p>So even when you&rsquo;re experiencing tough times, it&rsquo;s working for my good. Words are spirit and life. Speak peace and life into circumstances. When you&rsquo;re lead by the spirit you can&rsquo;t allow circumstances to lead. You must believe in God&rsquo;s word. <strong>Philippians 4:11</strong> <strong>– Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</strong> That&rsquo;s what I learned through experiences and trials. Cast down imaginations.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow your mind to wander. Take control of your thought life. <strong>Philippians 4:8 – Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</strong> Notice that nothing negative is there. Only think on the good things. Cast down those thoughts.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about tomorrow. Those who aren&rsquo;t saved, worry about tomorrow. </p>
    <p>There are birds and animals that wake every morning and they&rsquo;re not worried. Why should I be in fear?</p>
    <p>If it snows to the door, not one sparrow will starve. That&rsquo;s the God we serve. </p>
    <p>Do you ever see a dead bird? You are a royal priesthood. A holy nation. Why are you worried.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 5:6-7 – Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</strong> <strong>7</strong> <strong>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</strong> Don&rsquo;t hold back anything. Cast all cares upon God. When I submit it to God – no matter what happens. He cares. </p>
    <p>When the thought comes to mind, remind it that you gave it to Jesus.</p>
    <p>It takes faith. We walk by faith and not by sight. Put on the whole armor of God.</p>
    <p><strong>Colossians 3:1 – If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</strong> Seek those things above. Set your affections on things above. Don&rsquo;t worry about the stuff on earth. There is no lack in our lives. There is no inefficiency in the God we serve. </p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:6 - Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 2:20 –</strong> <strong>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</strong></p>
    <p>Flesh is dead. We are no longer bound/lead by our emotions. We are grounded in the word of God. Flesh and spirit are constantly battling because the flesh always lusts after the spirit. </p>
    <p>Fear is an emotion experienced in anticipation of a danger. Fear shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of someone living for God. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. </p>
    <p>Fear shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of our character. We shouldn&rsquo;t be fearful. Stir up the gift of God. Paul was saying to Timothy that he has the power already but he had to stir it up. </p>
    <p>Because our thinking is affected by observation, association and teaching; our thinking is affected by the things we see, the people were around and the teaching we receive. Who are you? Who told you who you were? Was the teaching valid? </p>
    <p>To know this we must transform our mind. Unless the transformation occurs we live in a state of never enough. All that I need, God has already supplied. We must develop in love and faith. When we develop in those areas we have faith. </p>
    <p>What occurs in my life – I will be victorious. Whenever I&rsquo;m facing something, I must remember <strong>Psalm 103:3 – Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases. </strong></p>
    <p>Fear will cancel God&rsquo;s promises in your life. If I&rsquo;m fearful I&rsquo;m not trusting God <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> I need to please God. This is my sole objective. When pleasing God is my sole purpose, all will be given to me. </p>
    <p>Fear attacks your mental state. Fear paints a picture of you failing. We are motivated to become what we imagine ourselves to be. Fear paints a picture on the canvas of your imagination.</p>
    <p>If you accept the image of fear you are accepting a lie. What you don&rsquo;t know will affect what you believe. <strong>Matthew 28:18 – And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</strong> We have the power in heaven and earth.</p>
    <p><strong>Luke 10:19 – Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</strong> When you get an image of someone overpowering you, read <strong>Luke 10:19</strong>. Nothing will hurt you. It may come upon you, but it won&rsquo;t hurt you. </p>
    <p>God didn&rsquo;t <strong>give</strong> us a spirit of fear. Fear came from the enemy. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:8 – He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</strong> We must love. We can&rsquo;t put limitations or be selective in who we love. </p>
    <p>There are some that you shouldn&rsquo;t associate with but you can&rsquo;t hate them. We are delivered from fear. When you are in fear you create a problem by what you say out of your mouth. We must be mindful of what we receive. </p>
    <p>As overcomers we must change our conversation. <strong>Psalm 91:2 – I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. </strong>I will say of the Lord. Remember always that God is in control.</p>
    <p><strong>Jeremiah 1:19 – And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</strong> We get the mentality of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. We must speak to things in our lives. </p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re going to have struggles, but don&rsquo;t be fearful. The moment where you look like you&rsquo;re about to be defeated is when your miracle is coming.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t ask God, &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Your purpose is in you. <strong>2 Corinthians 4:7 – But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</strong> We have treasures in early vessels. </p>
    <p>We have assurance and conviction but we must have confidence. Confidence must be expressed in every believer. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t have fear and faith. My faith doesn&rsquo;t depend on a particular time-frame. </p>
    <p>When the enemy wants to do something, he puts a person in your life. When God wants to do something, he puts a person in your life. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 13:5-6 – </strong><strong>5&nbsp;</strong><strong>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6&nbsp;</strong><strong>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. We must have the confidence that whatever we pray for, we shall have. Jesus doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything else for us. </strong></p>
    <p>The Lord is my helper. I will not fear what man can do to me. You have to get your thinking around this passage. </p>
    <p>If I&rsquo;m seeking God for something I won&rsquo;t covet what others have. Be content with what you have.</p>
    <p>Be content – Because he will never leave nor forsake us. With that assurance, I can blindly say that the Lord is my helper. </p>
    <p>Every situation – the Lord is my helper.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry renounce the spirit of fear, have the confidence to believe that God will take care of everything. </p>
