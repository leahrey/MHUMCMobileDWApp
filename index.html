  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong><div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="clouds.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="115"></div></strong>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Impossibility is God's Speciality<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong>  Ephesians 2:8, John 3:16, Luke 2:9, Philippians 2:6 - 7, Romans 5:18 - 19, Philippians 10:9-2, John 1:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      Christmas is a time of giving. This pattern of giving began in Ephesians 2:8 - For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong><br>
      <br>
      When we consider the gift of God we must reflect on Luke 2:9 - And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.<br>
      <br>
      The child that was born was humanity; the son that was given is divinity. The word became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
      <br>
      While the world goes about it's business of sales and markdowns; God sends his son wrapped in swaddling clothes and born in a manger. He was given a common name, Jesus. But there was something special about this birth.<br>
      <br>
      God had already pre-ordained the inn being full and the child being born in the manger. Do you have room for Jesus? Or is your life so full of clutter that you are focusing on other people and things.<br>
      <br>
      How well do you treat others?<br>
      <br>
      Be careful how we entertain strangers, we could be entertaining an angel.<br>
      <br>
      The angel announced his birth, his resurrection, and will announce his return.<br>
      <br>
      God has plans that we can't change.<br>
      <br>
      The Relevance of Christmas - <strong>Philippians 2:6 - 7 - Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. </strong><br>
      <br>
      He became like us so we may be like him.<br>
      <br>
      Christ came to the lowly, to shepherds in the fields watching their flock. He didn't come to the affluent and the high.<br>
      <br>
      When you are wrapped up in your affairs you can't see the gift. We have lists, goals and plans but don't focus on Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      God became a man that's the meaning of Christmas!<br>
      <br>
      Jesus was born like us, he grew like us and was tempted like us; so he can understand us and our struggles.<br>
      <br>
      Jesus came to die for us all.<br>
      <br>
      He came as a sacrifice - the ultimate sacrifice.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 5:18 - 19 - Therefore as by the offense of one's judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Christ's obedience to God's plan to make us righteous after Adam's sin made us all sinners. </strong><br>
      <br>
      The issue is not whether you will admit that Jesus was born because according to <strong>Philippians 10:9-2</strong> - <strong>Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that he is Lord. </strong><br>
      <br>
      Christ loved us, when we didn't know how to love.<br>
      <br>
      On December 25th there will be a multitude opening gifts and the greatest gift will be standing at the door knocking.<br>
      <br>
      If you open the door, he will come in.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>John 1:12 - But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. </strong>We must receive him.<br>
      <br>
    Jesus is the reason for the season.</p>

    <h1>Are You Bound or Are You Free?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> December 7, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id ="image"><img src="waterfallsm.jpg" width="150" height="94"><br></div>
    <strong></strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Jeremiah 8:18, Titus 2:13, Titus 1:16, 2 Timothy 2:5<br>
    <strong></strong><br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Are You Bound or Are You Free?<br>
    <br>
    Jeremiah 8:18 – When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. Titus 2:13 – "while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ"<br>
    <br>
    Christ will come at the least expected time. <br>
    <br>
    As it was in the day of Noah, so is it now. The Lord himself shall descend from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first. <br>
    <br>
    When the trumpet sounds, everything will stop!<br>
    <br>
    When Christ returns the first time, he will return for his church. The dead in Christ shall rise, first. When Christ returns the second time, he will return for judgment. Those who did not rise the first time, will rise to be judged by Christ. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 25</strong> – He shall separate them one from another to judge.<br>
    <br>
    Are you bound or are you free? There can be no "maybe" or "I think so". You must be sure.<br>
    <br>
    Some profess that they believe in God. Demons also believe that God exists. <br>
    <br>
    Some claim to know God – but deny him by the way they live. They praise God on Sunday and cut up when they leave the church.<br>
    <br>
    God calls on us to be holy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 2:5 </strong><strong>– </strong>Preach the word – for the time will come when you will not endure sound doctrine. <br>
    <br>
    We are in the last days. The last days began at the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. We have always been in the last days.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 9:17</strong> – "The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God" – We must pray for those who don&rsquo;t know Christ. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We must let go of un-thankfulness, un-forgiveness and being un-loving. If you let go of those things, your health will improve.<br>
    <br>
    Don&rsquo;t let craziness put you in the ground.<br>
    <br>
    The word of God explains our position, right now.<br>
    <br>
    Don&rsquo;t judge unless the real judge will judge you. <br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong> <strong>Proverbs</strong> <strong>6 </strong>– These things the lord hates<br>
    <br>
    Some of us are quick to destroy someone&rsquo;s reputation. Regularly attend church service- on every committee, but won&rsquo;t submit to the authority of Christ. <br>
    <br>
    Obedience and love are the traits of a Christian.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong> – You must obey your leader. He must give an account for everyone in the congregation.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Peter 4:17</strong> – For the time has come for judgment to being in the house of the Lord. God will judge the church first. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 22</strong> - Love your neighbors as you love yourself. Let&rsquo;s not be selfish or self-centered. <br>
    We can&rsquo;t be prideful in positions. <br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong> <strong>1 Corinthians 13:14</strong> – Don&rsquo;t be puffed up. Love never gives up – Love cares more for others than self.<br>
    <br>
    If you yield yourself to things that aren&rsquo;t of God you are under the control of whatever you yield to.<br>
  We are blessed and saved – all of our needs are met and we represent Christ. </div>

    <h1>Starting Over</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <div><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Starting Over<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="road.jpg" width="150" height="100"></div></div>
    <div><strong>Date:</strong> November 23, 2014</div>
    <div><strong><br>
      Scripture: </strong>Philippians 3:7-14, Philippians 4:8, John 5:7</div>
    <div><strong><br>
      Notes</strong>:<br>
      <br>
      How do you begin again? When your life has been interrupted by failed relationships, trials and tragedy it is difficult to let go and start over. Starting over is a process. Some steps are crucial to starting over successfully.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Letting go – there are probably things that you hold onto that you&rsquo;ve held on to for years.</div>
    <div>There are times in life when you have to let go of people – places and things. The one thing that keeps you from your destiny is your past.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Philippians 3:7-14 – Sometimes we don&rsquo;t understand life. That&rsquo;s why we must wait on the Lord.</div>
    <div>It&rsquo;s easy to form an attachment to people or things and it&rsquo;s hard to let go. Every person that comes into your life has a purpose or aren&rsquo;t in your life to stay. Some folks don&rsquo;t mean you well. Have no fellowship with them.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Letting go can be painful. The intolerance of your present will create your future. Every relationship is a current – it moves you towards your dream or away from your dreams.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Hanging on to resentment allows someone to live rent free in your head. Never let someone build your world for you. They will build it too small.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Forget about the past – don&rsquo;t let others remind you of the past. When you don&rsquo;t forgive you put yourself in a box.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>If you want to start over you must first deal with the damage. Ask the right questions. Starting over will be rough, but we will make it. I&rsquo;m not going to allow anything to stop me.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>Many are the afflictions of the righteous. The difference between success and failure is how you handle pressure.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>There are times when the enemy will put you in the pressure cooker. But God has the power. Just like the palm tree – we can bend, but we won&rsquo;t break.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div><strong>Three ways to help you let go</strong></div>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li> Enjoy yourself - don&rsquo;t let anything get you down.  Those who control the pain of today can&rsquo;t control the pleasure of tomorrow.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Release the grief – emotions of anger, fear and labels – there is something more precious in you than what people say.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t rehearse your failures tomorrow is another day. Get over it – if you keep talking about it, you will be right back where you were. Don&rsquo;t allow others to remind you. If you worry and pity yourself, you will become a pitiful person that no one wants to be around.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Life won&rsquo;t always be happy. You&rsquo;re not always going to wake up on the sunny side of the street – deal with it.<br>
      <br>
      Happiness doesn&rsquo;t depend on who you are – it depends on how you think.<br>
      <br>
      Philippians 4:8 – Think on these things, think on the positive and not the negative. If you allow yourself to think about the negative you will find plenty of negative things to think about.<br>
      <br>
      Wake up in the morning with a positive attitude. Wake up and be thankful for another day.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t repress it – Don&rsquo;t hold it in – Some people hold stuff in and then one day, they explode. Let it out – don&rsquo;t hold it in. Don&rsquo;t hold on to the pain, disappointment and old negative memories.<br>
      <br>
      Release it! Life isn&rsquo;t a dress rehearsal, stop practicing and just do it!<br>
      <br>
      Stop making excuses – <strong>John 5:7</strong> – Jesus was asking the man at the pool if he wanted to be healed. The man had wasted over 30 years sitting near the pool. When Jesus came to him, the man gave Jesus nothing but excuses for his condition.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the people that you wait to help you won&rsquo;t. They either can&rsquo;t help you, don&rsquo;t have time or don&rsquo;t really want you to succeed.<br>
      <br>
      What you say sets the stage for your life. Stop talking crazy stuff, it impacts your life.<br>
      <br>
      By your words you are justified, by your words, you will be condemned. Your victory is as close as the roof of your mouth.<br>
      <br>
      You must only speak positive things. Things turn out for the best – for those who make the best of things.<br>
      <br>
      You are not a loser, you&rsquo;re a winner. Dr. King once said, take the first step in faith. You don&rsquo;t have to see the whole staircase to take the first step.<br>
      <br>
      Accept what you can&rsquo;t change – focus on what you can. Tell God exactly how you feel – Don&rsquo;t tell other people. Others can&rsquo;t help you. Resist bitterness and ask yourself, do I want to be bitter or happy.<br>
      <br>
      When you harbor bitterness – you end up with sickness and illnesses. Cast your cares on him – for he cares. When you awake – spend time worshiping God – Don&rsquo;t make requests.<br>
      <br>
      Thank him – In all things, I give you praise.<br>
      <br>
      When you thank God for a little, you end up with a lot.Gratitude destroys depression. No born again person should be depressed or stressed. The church is more than a building. It&rsquo;s all about people helping people. Live life with eternity in view. Don&rsquo;t wait until the conditions are perfect.<br>
      <br>
      They&rsquo;ll never be perfect. Let go and remind yourself that this moment is the only one that we can be sure of – in this next breath we could be gone.<br>
      <br>
    Start over, Let it Go!</p>

    <h1>We must desire the sincere milk of the word</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 16, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="bible.jpg" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <strong>Scripture:</strong> Hosea 4:6, Galatians 3:3, 2 Timothy 3, 1 John 25, Psalms 119:113, Job 23:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> We must desire the sincere milk of the word<br>
      <br>
      Spiritual growth is the development of a Christ like character and faith that has to test our faith. Our faith will be tested. <br>
      <br>
      Being like Christ should be our goal. We must desire the sincere milk of the word in order to grow. <br>
      <br>
      Early will I seek thee. We need the word in our spirit and mind. We need to meditate, read and hear the word of God.<br>
      <br>
      Forsake not the assembly of saints – God speaks to the under-shepherd and the under-shepherd speaks to the sheep. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Hosea 4:6</strong> – my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. We as the saints of God are priesthood for non-believers. <br>
  <br>
      The mark of maturity is not to be tossed to and fro and not to listen to other doctrines or teachings. You must know truth. <br>
      <br>
      Present your body as a living sacrifice. Be not conformed to the world but transformed by the renewing of your mind. Put off the former conversations. Don&rsquo;t be judgmental or gossiper. Put off the former man. <br>
      <br>
      Some people prey on you while they say they&rsquo;re praying for you. Grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      We should all strive to mature. Philippians 3:13 – Yesterday is gone – we must leave it behind – stop resurrecting dead things. Stop losing sleep over it, tomorrow is a new day.<br>
      <br>
      It is he who causes spiritual growth.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 3:3</strong> – Why are you trying to become perfect with your own effort?<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 3</strong> – Scripture reveals to us what is wrong with our lives. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 John 25</strong> – We know that he dwells in us and we keep his word. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalms 119:113</strong> – I hate lies but I love the word of the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Job 23:12</strong> – God&rsquo;s word is needed more than my necessary food. Growth takes effort. It takes commitment and dedication. Seek those things that are above where Christ sits. Set your sights on things above and not on the earth. <br>
      <br>
      Walk upright before him. Change is inevitable. Growth is optional. <br>
      <br>
      You must change – you don&rsquo;t have to grow.<br>
      <br>
      God will take you anywhere you want to go, but he can&rsquo;t take you if you don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The word you memorize is the word that you will utilize.<br>
      <br>
      Grow in your relationships. Grow in the knowledge of God and we can make things better.</p>

        <strong>Scriptures: </strong>Galatians 5:23, 2 Peter 1:3, Hosea 3:6, 2 Corinthians 2:11, 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, Jeremiah 15:16, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 1 6:8<strong></strong><br>

        <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
        <br>
        Worry leads to stress which leads to diseases. A lot of people are in the hospital and sick because they are worried about what they can&rsquo;t change. <br>
        <br>
        Worry is a sin! You can&rsquo;t worry and believe God or pray a prayer of faith and worry. We must understand who we really are. <br>
        We are spirit beings – living in this body – we have a soul.<br>
        <br>
        The soulless areas are: your mind, your will, imagination, intellect<br>
        <br>
        Worry is caused by a lack of information or misinformation. Unless you&rsquo;re grounded in God&rsquo;s word, you receive untruths as truth. There are some things that may be a fact, but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the truth. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If you don&rsquo;t know the truth you&rsquo;re still in bondage. When you&rsquo;re in bondage you&rsquo;re unaware of what you already have. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>Galatians 5:23 – Gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</strong> Peace is a fruit of the spirit. <br>
  <br>
        Perfect peace is the only peace that comes from God. You can get a semblance of peace but if it&rsquo;s not from God it&rsquo;s only a semblance of peace, not perfect peace. <br>
        <br>
        If you&rsquo;re not aware of your peace it causes us to worry. <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. </strong>He gave us all these things. Once we get to know God – We&rsquo;ll understand. We must have knowledge.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 2:11 – In order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. </strong>The enemy has been doing this from the beginning. Unless you know the truth you&rsquo;ll believe a lie. <br>
  <br>
        We have the spirit of man and the spirit of God. We must first present our body as a living sacrifice and our minds must be transformed. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>There are 3 Type of People</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Natural Man – has no relationships with Christ. The things of God are foolish to him.</li>
        <li>Spirit Man – Living under the control of the holy spirit and minds the things of the spirit. Led by the spirit – lower animal passions have been crucified. Galatians 2 – Not I but Christ lives in me. </li>
        <li>Carnal Man – The carnal man is the immature Christian. Operates at a childhood level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:1-3 – Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly – mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</strong> <br>
        <br>
        When you are always involved in something negative – there&rsquo;s a problem. <br>
        <br>
        To know what&rsquo;s been given to us. We must desire the sincere milk of the word.<br>
        Early will I seek thee. Early when I rise – give me Jesus. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>The instructions you follow, will determine the future you create.</strong><br>
  <br>
        Develop new thought patterns. <br>
        <br>
        Your thoughts will determine your decisions, your decisions determine your action, your actions determine your habits, your habits develop your character, your character determines your destiny. <br>
        <br>
        Don&rsquo;t work on anything else – work on your character.<br>
        The knowledge of God brings peace, prosperity and promotion.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 15:16 – When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart&rsquo;s delight, for I bear your name, Lord God Almighty.</strong> We stand on the word. The word is a solid foundation that won&rsquo;t change.<br>
  <br>
        Don&rsquo;t get anxious, concerned or tied up with the world. God is our strength and refuge. <br>
        <br>
        God has promised that he won&rsquo;t hold back anything if we walk upright.<br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 6:3 – We put no stumbling block in anyone&rsquo;s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</strong> Nothing can upset me. I&rsquo;m not offended! <br>
        You can&rsquo;t be offended. Get your feelings off your sleeve. You can do anything, if you&rsquo;re not offended. <br>
        <br>
  <strong>2 Peter 1 6:8 – and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> </p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t be offended by everything. Get virtue and knowledge. Get temperance.<br>
        Discipline yourself. You must have self-control.</p>

    <strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> The Laws of Prayer<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Ephesians 3:13, Romans 13:1, Luke 10:19 -20, John 13:14<strong>, </strong>Hebrews 11:6, Hebrews 4:16, Mark 11:24-25, 1 John 5:14, 2 Chronicles 20:17, Romans 8:26, Philippians 4:6, Psalm 34:1, Joshua 23:14, Romans 8:38-39, 1 Peter 4:12, Psalm 33:9, Matthew 20:29<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
God&rsquo;s commitment to his purpose will never violate his spoken word. Prayers are not only effective in our lives it&rsquo;s also effective in the lives of those we pray for. Paul prayed for wisdom and understanding for the church in Ephesians. Jesus Christ, savior is the same as Christ our Lord. <br>
<br>
<strong>Ephesians 3:13 – I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. </strong><br>
<br>
Prerequisite for prayer - Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask God for what you need, according to his word. <br>
You must be rooted and grounded in the word. There must be a foundation.<br>
<br>
      James said to call on those who are seasoned in the word to pray. Everyone can&rsquo;t pray for you. Some people don&rsquo;t have the right mindset or their relationship isn&rsquo;t in order. Our primary focus should be to pray for others instead of for ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      If we only pray for ourselves, our prayer lives become selfish. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Romans 13:1 – Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</strong> The powers that be are ordained by God. Every leader in place has been placed there for a reason.<br>
  <br>
      Whoever resists that power, resist God and face damnation. We must obey those who are over us.<br>
      <br>
      We are heaven&rsquo;s representative in the earth. God gave the power to man in the earth. <br>
      <strong>Luke 10:19 -20 – I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.</strong> Prayer pleads the name of Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      We are heaven&rsquo;s representative in the earth. God gave the power to man in the earth.<br>
    <strong>John 13:14 – You call me &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet. </strong>There is an order to our prayers. We yield to the will of Christ in prayer. </p>
    <p>The following are key components to answered prayers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faith</li>
      <li>Praise</li>
      <li>Adoration</li>
      <li>Worship</li>
      <li>Confession</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>8 Laws of Prayer</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faith</strong> – we must have faith when we approach God. Hebrews 11:6 – with faith in God, I am not anxious about anything. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Boldness</strong> – Hebrews 4:16 We don&rsquo;t pray in a state of worry. You must come boldly to the throne. Know that he is a rewarder. You have the right to make your requests to God.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Right relationship</strong> – We need to have the right relationship. Everything we discuss must be in place. Mark 11:24-25 Un-forgiveness is one of the reasons for unanswered prayers. We need to forgive.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>The will of God -</strong> 1 John 5:14 When you ask according to his will, he hears us. When I rely on God and his promises I have the assurance that what I ask of God I shall receive. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Confidence </strong>– We must be confident that God will work in every area of our lives. 2 Chronicles 20:17. Conviction of God – Stand still and see the salvation. We must have confidence in every promise of God in every aspect. Never allow anything, anyone or any circumstance to cause you to doubt the word of God. God won&rsquo;t change. You can stand on the word of God. Be careful – don&rsquo;t allow time to change your belief system, because God has already told us that his way is not our way. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t pre-determine how God will answer your prayers - </strong>Philippians 4:6 – We have a promise, an agreement from God. I have confidence that when God answers my prayer, it will satisfy my needs. He knew what we needed before we asked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The law of the Holy Spirit Romans 8:26 – The blood of Jesus. You can plead the blood. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The law of praise</strong> – Psalm 34:1 - has nothing to do with how you feel or what you&rsquo;re dealing with, you will bless the Lord at all times. No matter what is going on in my life – praise is coming out.  He inhabits the praise of his people. Praises brings God into the midst of whatever we are dealing with.<br>
         </li>
      <li><strong>Reverence</strong> – You must fear God. You have the power to deliver when you have reverence for God. Everything is predicated on our faith in God.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no want for those who have faith in Christ – cast away anxieties, if you believe it, you shall have it. We have confidence in God&rsquo;s deliverance, word and promises<br>
      We must love the word<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Joshua 23:14 - Heaven and earth will pass away but my word will stand forever. </strong>My confidence must be centered in Christ. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Romans 8:38-39 – For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[a] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39&nbsp;neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong> Paul wrote that nothing will separate us from the love of God. We must be mindful in our prayer life that nothing will separate us from God&rsquo;s love. Confidence enables us to endure. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1 Peter 4:12 – Blessed are you if you are enduring. When you suffer God is glorified.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be surprised. The same thing that happens to us happens to everyone, but since we are the body of Christ we will be delivered. <br>
  <br>
      Judgment begins with us first.<br>
      <br>
      We have the assurance that God will keep us.<br>
      <br>
      I am a child of God<br>
      <br>
      I am saved and sanctified <br>
      <br>
      I have the heart of God on my mind<br>
      <br>
      If I have iniquity in my heart God won&rsquo;t hear me. When you pray to God remove all distractions, come to God alone. <br>
      <br>
      Give God glory when you pray. Give to others out of the abundance of what God has given to you. Jesus loves a cheerful giver. Remain in the anointing. Honor the Lord by reflecting the anointing. They should be able to see that you&rsquo;re a Christian. <br>
      <br>
      You are the light of the world. Cultivate the God kind of faith. Negative faith and positive faith can come by the same means – What we listen to and what we believe. Everyone has faith. We need the God-kind of faith if we want to operate in the kingdom.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Psalm 33:9 – For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</strong> He spoke and it was done. God spoke the universe into existence. When you ask for something in prayer, keep speaking about it and it will manifest. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Remember that what you say is a reflection of your heart.<br>
  <br>
      Faith is combined with expectation and action. <br>
  <br>
      Never allow the enemy to make you profess negativity. If you say you won&rsquo;t get it – you don&rsquo;t get it.<br>
      <br>
      They preach themselves out of it.  </p>

    <h1>Understanding Prayer</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">

    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Colossians 3:12, 1 Corinthians 13, Philippians 3:7-8, John 1:12, Romans 4:21, Hebrews 11, John 20:31, Psalm 125:1, Psalm 119, Ezekiel 22:30, 1 Peter 2:9, John 16:23, 2 Corinthians 10:4, Ephesians 1:3, Psalm 27, Galatians 5:16, Philippians 4: 6<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Understanding Prayer<br>
      <br>
There is an absolute connection between faith and prayer. How do I turn what the scripture says into the way I live? <br>
<br>
<strong>Colossians 3:12-13 – Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; (13) Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. </strong><br>
<br>
Have a forgiving spirit. Even as Christ forgave us; he forgave us while we were in our sins. Romans 8:5- We had the forgiveness. The word of God works for us. When our lives are in line with God. <br>
<br>
When we get our mindset and lifestyle conformed to this scripture then we are in the right relationship with Christ. <br>
<br>
When we are in the right place – we can make our requests known to God.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 13:2 – And thought I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. </strong>You can have faith but if you don&rsquo;t have love it doesn&rsquo;t profit you. Our standing in the word of God is determined by our love and faith.<br>
<br>
<strong>Philippians 3:7-8</strong> – <strong>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. (8) Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. </strong>Nothing else matters when it comes to our relationship with Christ. We must put nothing before Christ – With that understanding we must trust what God says will work in our lives, because of the promises/covenant with God.<br>
<br>
Take what God says and apply it – Never let your thoughts interfere with what God says. <br>
Sarah and Abraham had to trust in God. Abraham believed in God. He trusted in him. <br>
<br>
We as believers have circumstances that come up in our lives where we question, &ldquo;How will I do this?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not you – it&rsquo;s God. The strength comes from God. Whenever you face something that is hard remember that faith acts like it is, so even if it&rsquo;s not so, until it&rsquo;s so. <br>
<br>
It exists in the spiritual realm but it takes faith for it to be so. <strong>John 1:12</strong> <strong>– But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</strong> He gave those who received him, power. <br>
<br>
The word of God is the final. Authority, when everyone has their say – I&rsquo;m standing on the word of God.<br>
Be mindful of Satan&rsquo;s tactic to make you discouraged. We can call things that are not into existence.<br>
<br>
There&rsquo;s a difference between faith, belief and simply acknowledging something.<br>
Faith isn&rsquo;t a possession – it&rsquo;s a decision.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m going to trust in God – no matter what. We can&rsquo;t receive negativity as people of God.<br>
<br>
No matter the relationship – I can&rsquo;t be around doubtful people. <br>
<br>
Words are seeds that manifest in your life. <br>
<br>
If you profess that it won&rsquo;t get better, it won&rsquo;t. Faith works both ways. If you move from the place of believing that it will happen to doubting, it won&rsquo;t happen. <br>
<br>
Whatsoever you say, if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea, it will obey you.<br>
<br>
As Christians we persevere in faith. No one said it would be easy. Galatians 3 - Stand fast in the liberty of Christ. Don&rsquo;t go back to the old belief system. You can&rsquo;t fluctuate between the old believe system and faith. <br>
<br>
Doubt cancels out everything. Without faith it&rsquo;s impossible to please God. He&rsquo;s a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. <br>
<br>
God rewards us. There are times when issues arise in our lives. You be the first to reconcile. It blocks your blessings. You must get past it. Get on with your life.<br>
<br>
Both of us have an assignment in the kingdom. When you quarrel you are holding up God&rsquo;s work. God is not the author of confusion.<br>
<br>
If two brothers and sisters are at odds, it is our responsibility as Christians to help them reconcile to finish God&rsquo;s work. <br>
<br>
The school of faith teaches us to trust in God to solve our problems and trust in God when he decides not to solve our problems.<br>
<br>
Your way is not my way. He will never leave nor forsake us. We have promises in the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<strong>Romans 4:21</strong> <strong>– And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. </strong>All of the promises of God will be kept. He has no &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; promises. God&rsquo;s promises are as good as the real thing.<br>
<br>
<strong>Hebrews 11:39</strong> <strong>– And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise. </strong> they died in faith knowing that a heavenly promise would come to pass, but not during their lifetimes. <br>
<br>
Scripture is designed to produce faith.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>John 20:31 –But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. </strong> We serve a faithful God, it&rsquo;s a part of God&rsquo;s character to be faithful. Trust in God and his words. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 125:1 – They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</strong> When the storms of life come into your life – you need to have this verse in your spirit. <br>
<br>
Trials will come – many are the afflictions of the righteous. Remember to trust in God and in his promises. <br>
<br>
When you pray, go to the scripture and pray God&rsquo;s words back to him. When you do this, no problem can harass you. <br>
<br>
In our trouble and trials we are supposed to be the light of the world – because someone is always watching you.<br>
<br>
The enemy and his people look for us to fail. When we continue to stand, the enemy loses his mind. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 119</strong> – God needs our participation.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Ezekiel 22:30 – And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. </strong>We control our environment. <br>
<br>
You must say it with the confidence to believe what we say. <strong>1 Peter 2:9 – But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</strong> We are a royal priesthood, a holy nation, peculiar people. When God says that about me – It doesn&rsquo;t matter what others say about me.<br>
<br>
We as God&rsquo;s people have to live disciplined lives because of the distractions around us. <br>
<br>
The church has been taught for years about our unworthiness that we don&rsquo;t say what God says.<br>
<br>
Affirm your faith by verbalizing what the scripture says about us. <strong>John 16:23 – And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</strong> Ask and you shall receive. Whatever you ask for in Jesus name – will be.<br>
<br>
Walking by faith and not by sight. Put on mercy, long-suffering, forgiveness – then whatever we ask he shall give us. <br>
<br>
Power in prayer is not based on emotions but on the word of God. <br>
<br>
We don&rsquo;t win victories by being emotional. <br>
<br>
<strong>2 Corinthians 10:4</strong> – <strong> For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.</strong> Those who pray in faith will receive what they request. We must step contrary thoughts from entering our minds. Fiery darts of the wicked are contrary thoughts. The thoughts will come but you don&rsquo;t have to receive it. <br>
<br>
Never allow the image to form in your mind, especially over a long period of time.<br>
God doesn&rsquo;t have to answer immediately don&rsquo;t get discouraged when it doesn&rsquo;t come today.<br>
If he says it, it will happen. His words will not return to him empty.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> <strong>– Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.  </strong>We are already blessed. Everything in the natural world, existed first in the spiritual realm. <br>
<br>
We are chose – predestined. Prayers aren&rsquo;t based on emotions – We discipline ourselves not to become emotional when we are facing a crisis. <br>
<br>
<strong>Psalm 27</strong> <strong>– The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? </strong>Wait on the Lord – don&rsquo;t get emotional or upset. We must praise God. <br>
<br>
<strong>Philippians 1:6 – Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. </strong> God won&rsquo;t start something that he can&rsquo;t complete.  <br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t get emotional. <strong>Galatians 5:16</strong> <strong>– This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </strong>We are children of God. We should get excited about the victory. <br>
<br>
      We have a relationship with God. Our minds need to be renewed. The enemy attacks your mind. He tries to get us to think negative and feel sorry for ourselves. He wants us to feel alone.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow negativity in. Christ is our advocate. He stands for us.<br>
  <br>
      Christ died on the cross for us but won&rsquo;t help now? He died so that we could live. Living in the kingdom isn&rsquo;t simply existing. <br>
      Speak encouraging words.<br>
  <br>
      I&rsquo;m Blessed<br>
  <br>
      My Needs are Met With Christ<br>
  <br>
      I&rsquo;m Covered<br>
  <br>
      Speak scripture into your lives.<br>
  <br>
      When you do this what&rsquo;s on the inside changes our outward appearance.<br>
  <br>
      We must pray with confidence and compassion.<br>
  <br>
      Every experience in our lives god uses it for good.<br>
  <br>
      Joseph had a rough life. Everything happened to him. <br>
  <br>
      God is preparing you for something that&rsquo;s in your future, because you have purpose.<br>
      With purpose you must pursue it. Believers must be faithful and trusting<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4: 6</strong> – <strong>Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. </strong>We make our requests and we&rsquo;re thankful when we make our requests. <br>
  <br>
      Praise should always accompany our requests.<br>
  <br>
      Lord, Thank you!<br>
  <br>
      Continue to walk by faith not by sight. <br>
  <br>
      When you start feeling down start to praise God.<br>
  <br>
      Praise eliminates the sadness. We can&rsquo;t praise God and be sad.<br>
      Keep praising him!<br>
  <br>
      Keep saying that you are blessed.<br>
  <br>
    Don&rsquo;t let anything weigh you down.</p>

    <h1>Great Faith</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="fountain.jpg" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Great Faith<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures</strong>: John 15:16, Hebrews 11:6, Philippians 4: 6-7, Psalms 84:11, 1 John 3:18, John 15:5, Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 13:2, Genesis 17:15, Genesis 17, Galatians 3:26 , 3 John 2,  Job 36:11, Matthew 5:39<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>John 15:16</strong> – You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that will last. All things are possible if you believe. Whatever you ask the father in my name, he will give you, but you first must love one another. <br>
      Faith worketh by love.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong> – Without faith it is impossible to please God. When I diligently seek after God, I receive whatever I ask. I must block out distractions; my focus must be on God.<br>
      The just shall live by faith. If you seek God for something but have disbelief, God has no pleasure in you. If you question or worry you are not trusting in God.<br>
      <br>
      When your situation deteriorates you must still stay in faith. Job had all types of troubles. He kept his faith while things continued to get worse in his life. He was covered in boils from head to toe. When his blessings came, it was greater than he could&rsquo;ve ever expected; better than he had before. <br>
      <br>
      Not believing is the equivalent of not trusting in God. Since we know that God is with us, we must discipline our mind so we don&rsquo;t do anything contrary to what God has promised. <br>
      <br>
      The will of God – Constant questioning of God&rsquo;s will, every time you pray, is the greatest hindrance to God answering your prayers. <br>
      We must be obedient.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever you ask for in prayer, you shall receive. <strong>1 John 3:18</strong> – When we keep God&rsquo;s commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight, our prayers will be answered. We have to love others and keep his commandments. God won&rsquo;t say no to those who keep his word. <br>
      <br>
      Nothing is too hard for God and nothing promised by God for his children shall be impossible. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, but <em>all things</em> must line up with his word. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Philippians 4: 6-7</strong> – Be careful for nothing. You can hold God to his word. What he says is truth and it won&rsquo;t be changed. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalms 84:11</strong> – No good thing will he withhold from those who walk upright before him. God has no respect of person. He will supply all of our needs, when we ask in faith. We have the confidence in God to say I know he will do it. I don&rsquo;t know when he will do it, but he will keep me until the prayer is answered. <br>
  <br>
      When God doesn&rsquo;t answer our prayer exactly as we asked, we must take a step back and realize that God will give us what we need.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>John 15:5 – </strong>If you abide in me and I in you ask what you will. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> – the power that Jesus has, he gives to us. We have the power to call those things that are not, as though they are. <br>
  <br>
      In <strong>Genesis 1</strong> – God said and God saw. He spoke things into existence and then he witnessed it. <br>
      <br>
      There is nothing impossible for us. You must understand the tactics of the adversary. Cast down negative thoughts and imaginations. When you are believing God for a miracle, don&rsquo;t receive negativity. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>1 Corinthians 13:2</strong> – If you don&rsquo;t have faith or love you won&rsquo;t receive the blessings of God. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Genesis 17</strong> – God has a covenant with us. He doesn&rsquo;t go back on his covenant. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Genesis 17:15</strong> – God promised Abraham that he would be the father of a multitude and Sarah the mother of many nations. <br>
  <br>
      When God sets us up for something – we can&rsquo;t substitute.<br>
      <br>
      Since we are the righteous and just, we shall live by faith. We have to maintain a certain behavior. We must walk in the spirit. <br>
      <br>
      We have to maintain the right standing with God. We are saved and filled. No man can take us from God&rsquo;s hands. There may be times when something goes wrong in your life, but your standing will not be affected. When we don&rsquo;t do what pleases God our standing doesn&rsquo;t change. He won&rsquo;t go back on his word. God won&rsquo;t change.<br>
      Our faith in Christ gave us power. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Galatians 3:26</strong> – We are all one in Christ. We are Abraham&rsquo;s seed and heirs to the throne, according to the promise.<br>
  <br>
      Never say that the Lord put something on you. He didn&rsquo;t. He came to give us an abundant life. The enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>3 John 2</strong> – Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest  prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <br>
  <br>
      There are channels through where God supplies our needs. Our job is not a source of income; it is a channel from which God uses. <br>
      <br>
      I will prosper and be in health according to my faith.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Job 36:11</strong> – If they obey him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasure. <br>
  <br>
      He forgives all iniquities and heals all diseases. We need to have confidence and also self-control. Our winning is based on our ability to control our actions.<br>
      <br>
      We need to be still and know that he is God. Be still and wait. God does what he needs to do, but we must wait. There&rsquo;s a time to move and a time to be still. <br>
      <br>
      In a multitude of words there is confusion and doubt. If our actions aren&rsquo;t controlled in one area we lose control everywhere. <br>
      We must respond well to persecution. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Matthew 5:39</strong> – turn the other cheek to persecution. This is the make-up of the disciple. Although we are going through stuff we have a calling on our lives. We have kingdom business. We&rsquo;ve already committed to God.<br>
  <br>
      Cast your cares on God and leave it. Stand in faith. Keep believing God for a miracle.<br>
      <br>
      We are blessed – we must say that constantly. Rehearse your victory. Because we are overcomers, we shouldn&rsquo;t change our speech. It should be in line with our position. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Faith acts like it is so, even when it&rsquo;s not so, so it will be so!</strong><br>
  <br>
      You are a child of God; you can bless your home and your family. There is nothing contrary to the word. We are faith filled people. We walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes there will be obstacles and distractions; don&rsquo;t let that distract you. You may have to take a detour. When you take the detour – enjoy the scenery. <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy life – get up every day with the mindset that I will enjoy the day the Lord has made. <br>
    Enjoy your life – that&rsquo;s why Jesus came. He came to give us an abundant life. </p>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 12, 2014    <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> 2 Corinthians 5:7 – For we walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
There are times when our faith is tested and we must persevere through it all. The power of your speech is significant. Get out of an old belief or mindset. There are times when we are boxed in and we put God in a box.<br>
<br>
Say it until you see it.<br>
<br>
We are people of faith. We call those things that aren&rsquo;t as though they are. John 1: 12 – To as many who have received him, we have power to be, but we must be willing to become. Since all of the promises are yes and amen, I have all that I need. When it comes to God&rsquo;s promises, we must be tough-minded. When we don&rsquo;t move from what God says it strengthens our minds. Getting tough-minded about our purpose develops our character.<br>
<br>
<strong>2 Peter 3:14</strong> – We according to his promise must be steadfast. Be diligent –Be blameless. Get out of those negative environments.<br>
<br>
As Christians, we can create an atmosphere of victory. When we create an atmosphere we get an image of victory. If you can create an image – you can change the circumstances.<br>
<br>
We create the image by meditating on the image and the word of God.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Samuel</strong> – David was not moved by what he saw. <br>
<br>
If I made it through some obstacles yesterday and I&rsquo;m faced with a new problem, I must meditate on what God did before.<br>
<br>
Just like David recalled when God delivered him from the lion and the bear he can be delivered from the Philistine. You must have the same faith. Your faith must be equal to your confession.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mark 11:23</strong> – If you believe it; you will have it. Have the faith.<br>
We must talk expectations – not experiences. Experiences are in the past – expectation is what&rsquo;s in front of me. <br>
 <br>
Don&rsquo;t dwell on the past – since greater is before you.<br>
<br>
What he promised, he will bring it to past. <br>
<br>
<strong>Proverbs 10:12</strong> – the mouth of the righteous is a well of life – you must speak life. We must guard our speech.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t allow a situation to prophesize to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 2:4</strong> – We must endure and talk expectation. Endurance is a key to walk by faith. Be not weary. Your season will show up – if you endure. You shall reap if you faint not.<br>
<br>
      Faith is not a longing for something that will come to pass. True faith is a confirmation. <br>
      <strong>Genesis 22</strong> – If you can believe all things are possible. God doesn&rsquo;t tempt us, he tests us. Abraham had the God kind of faith. He travelled with his son for 3 days without questioning God.<br>
  <br>
      The promise that God gave Abraham in Chapter 21 overrode what fear he would&rsquo;ve had.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when your faith will be tested.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when you are believing God for something, where you can&rsquo;t be in the company of doubters and disbelief. They are sowing seeds. The doubters sow into your ear gate that plants the seed or they will remind you of how what you&rsquo;re seeking God for has failed someone else.<br>
  <br>
      Be careful who you allow into your environment. When you&rsquo;re believing God for a miracle. <br>
  <br>
      Luke 8:47 – Don&rsquo;t receive what you may hear about your circumstances. Stand on the promises. Never receive anything that&rsquo;s counter-productive to the word of God. No matter the situation – trust in God.<br>
  <br>
      There are times when you must separate yourself. <strong>Matthew 6</strong> – When you pray, pray in secret and the Lord will reward you openly.<br>
  <br>
      God is the same, yesterday, today and forever. We must control our actions – be in control or it will affect you.<br>
  <br>
      Your winning hinges on your ability to control your actions.<br>
  <br>
      There is a consequence of not trusting God. Hebrews 10:38-39 – The just shall live by faith. If any man draweth back, God has not pleasure in them. We must be faith-filled people. I must believe that he is God and believe that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. <br>
      <br>
      We must give God praise – thanks but we must be careful of what else we say. Guard your speech. <br>
  <br>
      Our performance doesn&rsquo;t determine our standing in Christ, because grace keeps us.<br>
  <br>
      My standing in Christ determines my performance.<br>
  <br>
      It&rsquo;s in him that we live, move and have our being.<br>
  <br>
      They who trust in the Lord shall not be moved. When things look shaky they&rsquo;re still working out for the good. Put a smile on your face and be of good courage.<br>
  <br>
      You always move in the direction of your desire. What you do daily affects your desire. Some things we shouldn&rsquo;t watch on T.V. because it sow seeds into the spirit. Faith is the capacity to trust in God even when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense; even when you feel like the only one going through. You just keep moving.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t dwell on the negative. Our lives don&rsquo;t change until we change our thoughts. There are some areas that hinder you from seeing God&rsquo;s point of view.<br>
  <br>
      Sometimes circumstances can make you utter words that are contrary to God.<br>
  <br>
      Stand in faith – wait on the Lord – trust in God.<br>
  <br>
      The word of God will stand forever. No matter what may come.<br>
  <br>
      Reflect on your previous experiences, but don&rsquo;t let it limit you from what God can do now.<br>
    Your past mistakes shouldn&rsquo;t prevent you from future increase. Satan is an accuser. He can&rsquo;t read our mind, but he hears what we say. He listens to what we say an seeks whom he can devour. </p>
    <p>Whatever you say will come to pass. God will not violate his word. You will have whatever you say. God won&rsquo;t go against his word. Your current circumstances and other people&rsquo;s experiences limit you. You are walking in the flesh when you pay attention to the past.<br>
      <br>
      Negative limiting words – words that entice you to quit. The enemy wants to keep you from seeing God working in your life. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Deuteronomy 28</strong>: you&rsquo;re already blessed. Guard your speech. I need a blessing, counter the word of God. <br>
  <br>
      God wants us to look like us but act like him.<br>
      <br>
    Don&rsquo;t get worried; keep saying it if it doesn&rsquo;t happen tomorrow, it will happen. </p>

    <p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="images"><img src="mountain.jpg" width="200" height="117"></div>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 28, 2014    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Preparation for Conquest</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Joshua 1:3, Hebrews 11:6, Joshua 1:8, 1 Corinthians 22:13, Isaiah 1:19, Psalm 119:15 &amp; 16, 2 Corinthians 4:7 &amp; 8, Psalm 119:112, Romans 8:38 &amp; 39, Ephesians 4:29, Ephesians 5:11, 1 Corinthians 2:14</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Joshua 1:3 – Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</strong>  </p>
    <p>We should be preparing to enter the new year at the next level. </p>
    <p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be dragging ourselves into 2015 with an &ldquo;I just made it&rdquo; attitude. You shouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with the same stuff that you dealt with in 2014.</p>
    <p>If you are dealing with the same stuff that you dealt with in January, there&rsquo;s a problem. </p>
    <p>Broken focus is the cause – set your sights on the things above where Christ sits. Don&rsquo;t worry about stuff. You should have high expectations for 2015, not worrying about the goals, plans and things that are behind.</p>
    <p>There are some things and people that you will have to let go of. Some people aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Their objective is to keep you from going somewhere. </p>
    <p>Begin todays being the person that you want to be next year – I have plans. The quality of your preparation determines the quality of your performance. </p>
    <p>You should be training your mind in the word of God. This could be the greatest year ever if you learn to trust in God without full understanding. </p>
    <p>Walk by faith!</p>
    <p>Your attitude determines your approach and your approach determines your success. </p>
    <p>How do you handle life&rsquo;s problems? What&rsquo;s your attitude toward your situation? What&rsquo;s your attitude towards others?</p>
    <p>Your attitude determines your success.</p>
    <p>Is there anything too hard for God? Then you must have the God-kind of faith. <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </strong></p>
    <p>Are you diligently seeking Christ? Get a can do attitude in your mind. What you practice is what you will ultimately become. If you practice lying, you will be a liar. If you practice stealing, you will be a thief. <br>
      <br>
      Get the image of an overcomer in your mind. Focus on the word of God. </p>
    <p>Faith without works is dead. </p>
    <p>Joshua 1:8 – meditate on the word day and night. We can&rsquo;t just take bits of scripture that we like. The bible is not a buffet table. We must meditate on the entire book.</p>
    <p>When I mediate on God&rsquo;s word I make my way prosperous. When you meditate on the word, day and night you shall be successful. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Chronicles 22:13 – Then shalt though prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes, and judgments which the Lord charged. Moses with concerning Israel; be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</strong></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re not successful because you have a lot of stuff, promotion comes from the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 1:19 – If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</strong> Be willing and obedient. </p>
    <p>God tests us by our faith and he measures us by our obedience.</p>
    <p><strong>Job 36:11 – If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</strong> All you have to do is obey and serve. We need a lifestyle of obedience. &ldquo;Lord whatever you say&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 119:15 &amp; 16 – I will meditate in they precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. (16) I will delight myself in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word. </strong></p>
    <p>We must obey God immediately. You don&rsquo;t need confirmation. Obey God joyfully. I will be happy about what God asked me to do. No excuses! I&rsquo;m going to delight myself. </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m blessed because I delight in his words. I&rsquo;m blessed because I obey and delight and meditate on your law. Early I will seek you – every morning where I rise, give me Jesus. </p>
    <p>One thing that will prevent you from receiving God&rsquo;s blessing is pressure – a lot of folks can&rsquo;t handle pressure. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 4:7-10 - But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. (8) We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair. (9) Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</strong></p>
    <p>We will be in situations but God keeps us. When you are in the storm you bend but you need to bounce back up, like a palm tree. Obey God in persecution. </p>
    <p>Speak faith-filled words when persecuted.</p>
    <p>You give your cares to Jesus. We won&rsquo;t be free from persecution. Many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivers us all. When you face persecution, you know that God will deliver you. </p>
    <p>Obey God continually – <strong>Psalm 119:112 – I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</strong> – Always. Always, I will obey God continually, without full understanding. I need to do exactly what he says. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:38 &amp; 39 – For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come (39) Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </strong></p>
    <p>When I face persecution it won&rsquo;t separate me from the love of God. Even when you are dealing with crazy people, remember that nothing will separate you from God&rsquo;s love. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch your speech – <strong>Ephesians 4:29 – Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. </strong>If you want to be successful in 2015 you need to let go of gossiping, rumors, repeating what you hear and speaking negative. Remember that silence can never be misquoted. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Be mindful of your associates – <strong>Ephesians 5:11 – And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. </strong>Who are your associates? Evil communication corrupts good manners.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Have a disciplined lifestyle – Your greatest goal in 2015 should be knowing God.    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:14 – But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </strong>Spiritual discernment the natural person doesn&rsquo;t understand spiritual discernment.<br>
      <br>
    We grow in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ. </p>

    <h1>2014 New Years Eve Service</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 31, 2014<div class="ui-li-aside" id="image"><img src="fireworks.jpg" width="200" height="150"></div></p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic: </strong>New Years Eve</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 12:1-2, Proverbs 3:5, Peter 5:10</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 12:1-2 - Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, (2) Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. </strong></p>
    <p>As we come to the close of the year we are evaluating our state at the moment. What would I do differently? What changes have to be made to get to a point of change and success?</p>
    <p>Determination = Commitment</p>
    <p>I must take an inventory of my life. What did I have in 2014 that I could do without in 2015?</p>
    <p>Who do I rely on in 2015? <strong>Proverbs 3:5 - Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</strong> Trust in the Lord - some of the things in 2014 will rob you of your joy in 2015.</p>
    <p>To everything there is a season. I must make radical changes. We must put on a fresh covenant. Intolerance of your presence invokes change.</p>
    <p>Examine Yourself - What needs improvement?</p>
    <p>Let us cleanse ourselves. Don't let stuff bog you down because time is precious. This moment right here you won't get back.</p>
    <p>You can't make up for yesterday. Change the set points in your mind. If you apply worldly principles to your life, you won't ever get to where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>When others talk negative about you - remember who made you. We are his workmanship. He made us.</p>
    <p>You are capable of more than others expect, dream or imagine you to be.</p>
    <p>Your purpose will protect you from being busy but not effective. You need a plan for next year. A lot of people miss their potential because they lack a plan.</p>
    <p>Knowledge without action will overpower you.</p>
    <p>Be determined to be where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>Stop figuring out for yourself where you should go. Let God lead you to where you need to be.</p>
    <p>God wants you out of your comfort zone in 2015.</p>
    <p>Of all the things you have to with in 2015, you must first deal with yourself.</p>
    <p>Examine yourself. Prune yourself. It's hard to admit that we are the problem.</p>
    <p>Your past will keep you from where God wants you to be.</p>
    <p>What didn't you accomplish in 2014?</p>
    <p>Permit unexciting dreams to die.</p>
    <p>Lay aside every wake - every sin - look at Jesus.</p>
    <p>Don't put your trust in man. Our desires are created by whatever we turn to most.</p>
    <p>Attend to God's word.</p>
    <p>The future isn't uncertain for saints of God. <strong>Peter 5:10 - But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</strong> After you suffer for a little while. You will deal with disappointment and sufferings. God never said that you wouldn't.</p>
    <p>Enjoy where you are on the way to where you're going.</p>
    <p>Enjoying life is not based on enjoyable circumstances. That's why James said to count it all joy. We must make the decision to enjoy everything. Even the little things matter.</p>
    <p>Spend quality time with God.</p>
    <p>Discipline yourself.</p>
    <p>Turn off the Television. Television is someone telling you their vision.</p>
    <p>Once you see that the world won't change, change your reaction.</p>
    <p>Life is a journey and everything in it is a process.</p>
    <p>Think outside the box.</p>
    <p>The potential to produce fruit doesn't determine if you will bear fruit or the quality of the fruit.</p>
    <p>Your assignment is not your decision. Your assignment is your discovery.</p>
    <p>Lay aside anything that robs you of your joy, peace and time.</p>

      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Understand the Real You<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures: </strong>Galatians 5:23, 2 Peter 1:3, Hosea 3:6, 2 Corinthians 2:11, 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, Jeremiah 15:16, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 2 Peter 1 6:8<strong></strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      Worry leads to stress which leads to diseases. A lot of people are in the hospital and sick because they are worried about what they can&rsquo;t change. <br>
      <br>
      Worry is a sin! You can&rsquo;t worry and believe God or pray a prayer of faith and worry. We must understand who we really are. <br>
      <br>
      We are spirit beings – living in this body – we have a soul.<br>
      <br>
      The soulless areas are: your mind, your will, imagination, intellect<br>
      Worry is caused by a lack of information or misinformation. Unless you&rsquo;re grounded in God&rsquo;s word, you receive untruths as truth. There are some things that may be a fact, but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the truth. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If you don&rsquo;t know the truth you&rsquo;re still in bondage. <br>
      <br>
      When you&rsquo;re in bondage you&rsquo;re unaware of what you already have. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 5:23 – Gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</strong> Peace is a fruit of the spirit. <br>
      <br>
      Perfect peace is the only peace that comes from God. You can get a semblance of peace but if it&rsquo;s not from God it&rsquo;s only a semblance of peace, not perfect peace. <br>
      <br>
      If you&rsquo;re not aware of your peace it causes us to worry. <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. </strong>He gave us all these things. Once we get to know God – We&rsquo;ll understand. We must have knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Corinthians 2:11 – In order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. </strong>The enemy has been doing this from the beginning. Unless you know the truth you&rsquo;ll believe a lie. <br>
      <br>
      We have the spirit of man and the spirit of God. We must first present our body as a living sacrifice and our minds must be transformed. <br>
      <br>
    <strong>There are 3 Types of People</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Natural Man – has no relationships with Christ. The things of God are foolish to him.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Spirit Man – Living under the control of the holy spirit and minds the things of the spirit. Led by the spirit – lower animal passions have been crucified. Galatians 2 – Not I but Christ lives in me. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Carnal Man – The carnal man is the immature Christian. Operates at a childhood level.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:1-3 – Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly – mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</strong> When you are always involved in something negative – there&rsquo;s a problem. <br>
      <br>
      To know what&rsquo;s been given to us. We must desire the sincere milk of the word.<br>
      Early will I seek thee. Early when I rise – give me Jesus. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>The instructions you follow, will determine the future you create.</strong><br>
      Develop new thought patterns. <br>
      <br>
      Your thoughts will determine your decisions, your decisions determine your action, your actions determine your habits, your habits develop your character, your character determines your destiny. <br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t work on anything else – work on your character.<br>
      <br>
      The knowledge of God brings peace, prosperity and promotion.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 15:16 – When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart&rsquo;s delight, for I bear your name, Lord God Almighty.</strong> We stand on the word. The word is a solid foundation that won&rsquo;t change.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t get anxious, concerned or tied up with the world. God is our strength and refuge. <br>
      <br>
      God has promised that he won&rsquo;t hold back anything if we walk upright.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 6:3 – We put no stumbling block in anyone&rsquo;s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</strong> Nothing can upset me. I&rsquo;m not offended! <br>
      You can&rsquo;t be offended. Get your feelings off your sleeve. You can do anything, if you&rsquo;re not offended. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Peter 1 6:8 – and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be offended by everything.<br>
  <br>
      Get virtue and knowledge. <br>
      <br>
      Get temperance.<br>
      <br>
      Discipline yourself.<br>
      <br>
      You must have self-control.</p>

          <br>
      <strong>Date:</strong> January 14, 2015<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Psalm 56:13, Isaiah 43:19, Psalms 1, Isaiah 48:17, 1 Kings 8:35-36, Jeremiah 6:16, Isaiah 1:19, Galatians 5:22-23 – 22, John 1:17, Isaiah 53:6, Philippians 4:19, Galatians 2:3, Matthew 7:13-14, Hebrews 11:6, Romans 8:28, Job 42-10, Psalm 75:6-7, Job 5:17,<strong> </strong>Philippians 4:12, 2 Corinthians 1:4, Philippians 1:12, 2 Timothy 2:10, Philippians 4:12<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      We travel through the world with God. <strong>Psalm 56:13 – For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life</strong>. When God delivered us from sin, he didn&rsquo;t just leave us. He keeps us, watches and guides us as we go from day to day.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 43:19 – See I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. </strong>God is telling us that changes will occur in our lives. Changes occur throughout our life span. There are things that we look at and we see it as an impossibility, but God will make a way. He will put rivers in the desert. We walk in God&rsquo;s way. We walk as he instructs us to walk. We should live our lives according to scripture in order to obtain blessings. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalms 1 – Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither – whatever they do prospers. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction. </strong>We are constantly following God&rsquo;s commands and being obedient to his word. This may put you in opposition with others. God teaches us his way – he teaches us what to do and how to do. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Isaiah 48:17 – This is what the Lord says your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: &ldquo;I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.&rdquo; </strong>God teaches us to prophet. <br>
      In the workforce we do Professional Development but God teaches us to prophet – This is how we gain wisdom. God leads us in the way we should go. We must be obedient – but he won&rsquo;t make us go. <br>
      <br>
      There&rsquo;s always the temptation to do something other than what God tells you to do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 Kings 8:35-36 – When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your  name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.</strong> Another key to living a holy lifestyle. Everything we need is in place we must live up to the standards and the word of God. Holiness, humility, joy, trust, peace, and obedience. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 6:16 – This is what the Lord says: &ldquo;Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, &ldquo;We will not walk in it.&rdquo;</strong> It isn&rsquo;t an absolute must to follow God. We have free will. God tells us how to walk but he doesn&rsquo;t make us. God will allow you to go against him. <strong>Isaiah 1:19 – If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land; </strong>Having these promises – we shouldn&rsquo;t allow anything to worry us.<br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow your fears about  your future to distract you from what you know. When we hold on to the word – we have the fruit of the spirit – love, peace, meekness and temperance. <br>
      <br>
      Read,<strong> Galatians 5:22-23 –</strong><strong> </strong><strong>22 -&nbsp;But the fruit&nbsp;of the Spirit is love,&nbsp;joy, peace,&nbsp;forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&nbsp;23&nbsp;gentleness and self-control.&nbsp;Against such things there is no law, </strong>every time you think those thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      Saints are encouraged by repetition, revelation and studying the word. We get the answer from the word of God then verbalize the word. Put the word of the Bible into your prayers. <br>
      <br>
      The unfaithful refuse to follow God&rsquo;s way because they don&rsquo;t know. Throughout 2015, you will come into contact with people who don&rsquo;t know God, but are looking for the opportunity to know him. <strong>John 1:17 – For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. </strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 53:6 - We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. </strong>We were once there ourselves. It&rsquo;s nothing we haven&rsquo;t experienced in our lives. Jesus took on the sins of the world and the opportunity to be saved is open to us all. <br>
      God will put you in the  midst of those who need to hear. You can&rsquo;t keep silent during these times. This year will be a blessing. We are blessed. We don&rsquo;t need to look for blessings. We don&rsquo;t need to manufacture our blessings. We are blessed. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you father for supplying all of my needs. <strong>Philippians 4:19 – And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. </strong>We must pray this every morning. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Galatians 2:3 – Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</strong> Everything that we need for this life is in Christ. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ. This is where we get our knowledge. <br>
  <br>
      We don&rsquo;t need to do anything devious to be promoted. All of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We don&rsquo;t have to do anything under-handed to get ahead.<br>
      <br>
      We must obey God.<br>
      <br>
      We must live the life that Christ has laid out for us. <strong>Matthew 7:13-14- Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. (14) But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it. </strong>There are a lot of people on the wide gate that leads to destruction.<br>
      <br>
      Faith carries us there – we walk by faith and not by sight.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. </strong>We must have faith. We must diligently seek Christ. We can&rsquo;t just seek him for the reward. Although he is the rewarder, we seek him because he&rsquo;s our shepherd not because we want gifts.<br>
  <br>
      Everything that we experience in life, there&rsquo;s a purpose. I don&rsquo;t lose the fruits of the spirit, while I&rsquo;m going through my situation. Just know that God&rsquo;s will is working.<br>
      <br>
      There will be times this year when we go through something we must ask God to let his will be done.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</strong> It&rsquo;s working for our good. We walk by faith because our natural understanding doesn&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s working for our good. Especially when we&rsquo;ve been obedient. When you have no ill thoughts for anyone, you know that it&rsquo;s working for our good. <br>
  <br>
      Consider Job – there are times when we are dealing with something that we should never wonder why something is happening to us, a child of God. Job had to pray for his friends. <strong>Job 42-10 – After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before.</strong> He had to pray for those who misunderstood him. You have to pray for those who don&rsquo;t understand you.<br>
      <br>
      That&rsquo;s when Job&rsquo;s life turned around. The blessings is in your prayers for others. <br>
      <strong>Psalm 75:6-7 – No one from the east or west or from the desert can exalt themselves. It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</strong> Promotion comes from God. There are times when we will encounter things but <em>Romans 8</em> reminds us that we are more than conquerors. <br>
  <br>
      You&rsquo;re not going to go through life with no problems – but you must study God&rsquo;s word and develop a deeper relationship with God. He uses every experience in our life for good. He uses them to warn us or to correct us.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 119:67 – Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.</strong> God uses every experience for our good. <br>
  <br>
      We get warning from God. We just need to listen to God&rsquo;s direction. God uses our afflictions and negative experiences to make us obey his word. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Job 5:17 – Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. </strong>God corrects us. We can&rsquo;t worry about why he corrects us. Blessed is the man whom God corrects. God uses our experiences to test and exercise our trust. We must trust him. He uses situations to test us to get us to trust him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:12 – I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. </strong> When we suffer a loss, we aren&rsquo;t utterly cast down. We may lose something but we aren&rsquo;t cast down.<br>
  <br>
      God exercises our trust – he wants us to trust him more. He uses these experiences to purify us and to prepare us for glory.<br>
      <br>
      I&rsquo;m coming out of this because I have continued to do all that which is pleasing to his sight.<br>
      <br>
      There&rsquo;s a purpose for everything. Nothing happens in our lives without purpose. Sometimes we experience things that benefit other people.<br>
      <br>
      Our minds can&rsquo;t fathom God&rsquo;s plan. <strong>2 Corinthians 1:4- who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.</strong>  In our situations we are able to comfort others with the same comfort that we experienced from God. This is the life of faith. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Philippians 1:12 – Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.</strong> When things happen in our lives it&rsquo;s not for us – it&rsquo;s to help someone else. Someone else will experience the same thing that we experienced. It happened to me so that I can share with others.<br>
  <br>
      God is preparing us for the assignment that he has for us in our future. <br>
      Remember in our sharing it must all point to Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We know the way to bring peace to someone who may not know the way.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 2:10 – Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</strong> We should be thankful and trusting in all life experiences.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:12 – For I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. </strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about anything. God controls it all. Be careful for nothing. Don&rsquo;t allow contrary thoughts to come in to your mind, telling you not to ask God for something.<br>
  <br>
    Praise God in the midst of your request. </p>

      <strong>2 Corinthians 9:6</strong> <strong>- But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. </strong>We are called to be disciples of Jesus Christ. With discipleship comes responsibilities. We have an assignment with the kingdom of God, so there must be a commitment. <br>
      <br>
Time, talent and treasure should be given. We own nothing. We are managers but not owners. We are only stewards. We don&rsquo;t own anything. God owns everything. Even with our children we give them back to God. We train them in the way to go so when they are old they will not depart. <br>
<br>
Giving is a command. Your giving is required to prosper in God&rsquo;s kingdom. We as God&rsquo;s people are under God&rsquo;s rule. <br>
<br>
Our mind must be transformed. The carnal mind won&rsquo;t allow you to give. The carnal mind sees everything as if it belongs to you. &ldquo;I worked for this money. It belongs to me.&rdquo; But it really belongs to God.<br>
<br>
We must move away from the world&rsquo;s system of mine, mine, mine. <br>
<br>
When we became Christians we left the world and came to God. <br>
<br>
Reception and Appreciation – we must receive the word by faith and then apply it to all areas of our lives. When I do that I become a doer of the word, not just a hearer. <br>
<br>
<strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> <strong>– What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</strong> Your body is a temple. You are not your own; you&rsquo;ve been bought with a price.<br>
<br>
Our possessions are not ours. <br>
<br>
<strong>1 Chronicles 29</strong> <strong>– But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</strong> All things come of thee and of thine own. God of yours we give back to you.<br>
<br>
The kingdom of God must be my first priority. If the kingdom of God isn&rsquo;t first, I become carnal in my thinking. I become selfish and selfish-serving. Success becomes another form of failure. We&rsquo;re never satisfied.<br>
<br>
Your tithe is your seed. It does you no good in your pocket. You can&rsquo;t reap the harvest because you have not planted the seed.<br>
<br>
We must walk in the word or we will end up somewhere we shouldn&rsquo;t be. I must trust God with my possessions as I do with my salvation.<br>
<br>
All to Jesus, I surrender. All to him I freely give. <strong>Jeremiah 17:7</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the&nbsp;Lord, and whose hope the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;is.</strong> Happy is he who trust in the Lord.<br>
<br>
<strong>Luke 6:38</strong> <strong>–</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</strong><br>
<br>
Benefits come through obedience. If you obey and serve him; you will eat the good of the land. There should be no struggling, lacking or poor saints. If you follow in his word. Let God be truth and every man, a lie. What is your attitude when you give to the kingdom?<br>
<br>
Trust in the Lord and do good; don&rsquo;t give grudgingly.<br>
<br>
If God loves a cheerful giver, what of those who grudgingly give?<br>
<br>
Once you release what&rsquo;s in your hands, what&rsquo;s in heaven will be released to you.<br>
<strong>Galatians 6:7-8</strong> <strong>– Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</strong> You will reap what you sow. You must sow bountifully. Giving should be a persistent joy to give.<br>
<br>
Every opposition against giving should be cast down.<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t become prideful about materials. When you become prideful about your possessions they become your God.<br>
<br>
Your abilities aren&rsquo;t responsible for what you have. <br>
<br>
Every check given to you is from God. It must come into his storehouse.<br>
<br>
You can&rsquo;t give your tithes to anyone. When you do something else with your tithes, you&rsquo;re stealing from God. <strong>Proverbs 3</strong> – trust in the Lord. Your seed is the only influence you have over your future.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ecclesiastes 11:1</strong>- <strong>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</strong> The seed that leaves you hand, never leaves your life. It enters your future and it multiplies.<br>
<br>
When we sow a seed we agree with God&rsquo;s word that it will increase in our life.<br>
<br>
We must wait for it to grow.<br>
<br>
When God blesses us we must remember the poor.<br>
<br>
Our outward circumstances shouldn&rsquo;t inhibit our giving.<br>
<br>
When pleasing God is our goal, God will flood our lives with the blessing. <br>
<br>
  <strong>Proverbs 19:17 – He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</strong></p>

    <h1>Obedience and Discipline </h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 21, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image4"><img src="biblecollage.png" width="200" height="159" alt="journey"></div>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 John 2 4:5, Proverbs 12:22, 1 Timothy 2:4, Matthew 14:18, Matthew 22, Isaiah 5:14, 1 Thessalonians 5:18, Psalm 104, 1 Thessalonians 4:7, 1 Peter 1:15,  1 Peter 2:15, 1 Peter 3:17, Peter 4:19<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      God&rsquo;s will is revealed in his word. <strong>1 John 2 4:5</strong> – When we obey God&rsquo;s word we know that we are in him. The fulfillment of the word comes from Christ. <br>
      <br>
      We must be obedient to the word of God. God&rsquo;s will for the world is justice and righteousness. He desires honesty and truth. We can&rsquo;t lie or verbalize untruth with each other or with God.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Proverbs 12:22</strong> – God desires honesty and truth. God delights in our honesty and when we are truthful with each other. Sometimes we withhold truth because we don&rsquo;t want to hurt feelings but by not verbalize the truth we end up hurting them more in the end. <br>
      <br>
      Especially, neighbors, friends and relatives who aren&rsquo;t saved. It&rsquo;s God will for the world to be saved.<br>
      <br>
      We must be a witness to others so they will know the truth. <strong>1 Timothy 2:4</strong> – God wants everyone to be saved. Even the worst of us. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Matthew 14:18</strong> – God doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to be lost. God&rsquo;s will for us loving obedience. <strong>Matthew 22</strong> – I must obey God without full understanding.<br>
      I must be obedient to God even if it causes opposition with  my closest associates. We must obey. Joshua – as for me and my house, it&rsquo;s my responsibility to bring it in line to the will of God. The man is the head of the house.<br>
      <br>
      Not only do we have instruction, our husbands do too. Husbands shouldn&rsquo;t go outside of God&rsquo;s will, wives don&rsquo;t go beyond their husbands. <br>
      <br>
      Scripture makes obeying God the highest priority over performing religious acts. Obeying God takes precedence over serving on church boards.<br>
      <br>
      God desires us to be willing and obedient. <strong>Isaiah 5:14</strong> – There are situations where you are willing but not obedient.<br>
      <br>
      God grants us mercy so we must in turn show mercy. God forgives us so we must forgive others because one time or another we&rsquo;ll need God&rsquo;s forgiveness.<br>
      There should never be a time when you are in the midst of worship and not be ready to bless the name of the Lord.  <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:18</strong> – in everything give thanks, not for everything give thanks. <br>
      <br>
      It could&rsquo;ve been worse – thank you Lord for saving/keeping me. Even in the worse of situations you said that all things would work for the good. Even when we don&rsquo;t see it, we must know that it&rsquo;s working for our good. All we have to do is discipline ourselves to wait on when it will manifest.<br>
      <br>
      We also can&rsquo;t set time limits. We must know that he promised it and he will keep us until it comes to pass. <strong>Psalm 104</strong> – Now with this knowledge I can bless his name. You need to praise him, just because you are still alive. Whatever you are dealing with there is someone else worse off than you. He wont put more on you than you can bear.<br>
      <br>
      God desires us to worship him – He inhabits the praise of his people. The more you praise him, the better you&rsquo;ll feel. You can praise your way through and out of situations. <br>
      <br>
      We know what he promised. He desires us to worship and be holy. <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:7 </strong>– He called us to be holy. We must walk upright before him and be holy.<br>
      <br>
      We must discipline ourselves to be holy. We need this lifestyle so we may let our light shine. When people see you they must see a Godly person. People want to know Jesus. <strong>1 Peter 1:15 </strong>– In everything we do we must watch our speech. We must watch the conversations that we&rsquo;re involve in. Don&rsquo;t join in unholy conversations. You&rsquo;re adding fuel to the fire.<br>
      <br>
      You must discipline yourself not to listen to gossip. God calls us to love each other. God didn&rsquo;t say, that the person we&rsquo;re supposed to love should behave a certain way. We must still show love. <br>
      <br>
      John 15: - - We must be willing to give the ultimate sacrifice. God desires that we have a high moral standard. Some things we shouldn&rsquo;t be involved in <strong>1 Peter 2:15</strong> – People will try to involve you in their foolishness. We must do what God tells us to do.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes abiding by God&rsquo;s will involves suffering. We are not in this life to be free from suffering. God doesn&rsquo;t give you anything to get your attention. He can get your attention if he wants to. <br>
      <br>
      There are times where it involves suffering.<strong> 1 Peter 3:17</strong> – The will of God. If you suffer for well doing, Christ is glorified (1 Peter 3:17) Don&rsquo;t despise the chastening of the Lord. Don&rsquo;t get bent out of shape when we&rsquo;re chastened. 1 <strong>Peter 4:19</strong> – If I suffer according to his will, I commit my soul to God.</p>

    <strong>Date:</strong> January 28, 2015<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 10:10, John 6:63, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:3, Genesis 1, John 17:8, Mark 9:23, Mark 11:22, Hebrews 11:6, 2 Peter 1:3, Psalm 84:11 – 12, 2 Corinthians 1:20, Joshua 1:8, Psalm 34:9, Ephesians 3:9, 2 Chronicles 4:7, Romans 8:12<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper. This is a promise from God. When our lives line up with the word of God we can access and receive prosperity and health. <br>
    <br>
    God has called us to holiness and righteousness. Above all things God heals us of our sickness and diseases. Even as our soul prosper our inner mind, thoughts and hearts must be transformed. <br>
    <br>
    In order to prosper we must obey God&rsquo;s will. Whatever it takes, I must obey God without full understanding. <br>
    <br>
    Walk by faith not by sight. When I walk by faith and not by sight, I&rsquo;m not distracted by the negative going on around me. I must obey God.<br>
    <br>
    Changes will occur in our lives but we can&rsquo;t move away from the word. Faith is important because we are a people of faith.<br>
    <br>
    We can&rsquo;t talk about faith without talking about spiritual warfare. Everything to leading a life of Godliness is in the word of God. God has given me his best. I&rsquo;m not going to accept second best.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>John 10:10 – The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</strong> Whatever level of life we are at; there is another level out there for us because Christ came so we could have abundant life. We become more loving and more spiritual. We are able to withstand more. When we are in places where we are under pressure we must remember that we are victorious.<br>
    Keep the mindset that you are victorious. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>John 6:63 –</strong> <strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</strong> God&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. We take God&rsquo;s words and speak those words into whatever situation we are in.<br>
  <br>
    Depending on the situation, take the scripture and put it on your life. When you are studying the word of God, read it so you can hear it because faith comes by hearing.<br>
    <br>
    When I speak the word into the spirit man takes control over the carnal man.<br>
    Speak the word boldly. <br>
    <br>
    We are blessed right now. Every resource needed for Godly living we have right now – because God gave us his life. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.</strong> Don&rsquo;t become discouraged when you are dealing with a situation that won&rsquo;t seem to change. Speak the word of God into the situation and believe it will change. <br>
  <br>
    The word of God will not fail. In order to receive what God has given to us, we need the knowledge of God.<br>
    <br>
    Since the mouth of the righteous is a well of life, we must train our speech so we don&rsquo;t contradict what God has said. You can&rsquo;t say that it won&rsquo;t get better. This contaminates your faith.<br>
    <br>
    We walk by faith and not by sight, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter how it looks. Situations and circumstances create pressure. You will have to endure pressure. How can you handle the alone times?<br>
    <br>
    The best time to meditate and speak the word into your situation is when you&rsquo;re alone. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1</strong> – God gave us the key to operate in a spiritual life. God said, God said then God saw. We must keep saying it until we see it.<br>
  <br>
    We have the assurance that we will prosper and be in health, but the assurance comes from God.<br>
    <br>
    We must pay careful attention to what we say because your words are spirit and life. Death and life are in the power of the tongue.<br>
    <br>
    We have the assurance because of God&rsquo;s word. <strong>John 17:8</strong> <strong>– For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</strong> This is the faith part. We believe that the word of God is true. We believe that we are blessed. <br>
    <br>
    My belief in being blessed isn&rsquo;t predicated on me having stuff. I believe it by what I know, not by what I see. I have the assurance because of God&rsquo;s oath and his promises to us.<br>
    <br>
    The words know, known and knowledge are written 1400 times, in the bible. The idea is centered around knowing God. Knowing God, I have the assurance. <br>
    <strong>Mark 9:23</strong> <strong>– Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</strong>All you have to do is believe. Take the verse literally. All things are possible to them that believe. No matter the situation, if I believe with unwavering faith, God will supply my needs. We must not allow doubt to creep in. <strong>Mark 11:22</strong> <strong>– And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</strong> Have faith in God. Don&rsquo;t doubt believe. <br>
  <br>
    The words that I speak out of my mouth, I will have. Words are powerful.<br>
    <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong> <strong>– But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> Without faith it is impossible to please God. When I approach circumstances I must speak faith filled words.<br>
  <br>
    When God says whosoever he meant any and everyone.<br>
    <br>
    I believe what I say will come to pass. <br>
    <br>
    It is already in place in the heavenly realm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong> – <strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.</strong> We already have the good things. We must control our speech, flesh and minds. God shows us what&rsquo;s good in the word so we can&rsquo;t get caught up in the world. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Psalm 84:11 – 12</strong> – <strong>For the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> God is a sun and shield: the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 12&nbsp;O </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</strong>
    <p>If I&rsquo;m trusting in God, I&rsquo;m blessed. He&rsquo;s not going to withhold anything good. He love us so much that some things that we want aren&rsquo;t good for us and he withholds it. He protects us because of his covenant with us. God guides and protects us from bad things.   <br>
      <br>
      There are times when we don&rsquo;t fulfill the love of the spirit, we follow our flesh, so God withholds it from us. <br>
      <br>
      We should be grateful. God does more than give to us. He&rsquo;s our keeper, protector and guide. We must stay in faith. All things are given to those who believe. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 1:20 – For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. </strong>All of the promises of God are yes and Amen.<br>
  <br>
      There must be reception and application <strong>Joshua 1:8 – This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>We must meditate on the word of God day and night. <strong>Psalm 34:9</strong> <strong>– O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</strong> We need to have reverence for God. God already said that there is no want to them who fear the Lord. <br>
      <br>
      There will be times where you may not have the bible in your hands but you must meditate on the word in your heart. <br>
      <br>
      That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to be lead by the spirit so you don&rsquo;t fulfill the lust of the flesh.<br>
      <br>
      There are things that look pleasing to the eyes but aren&rsquo;t good for us. God loves us to much that he protects us from our own wants and decisions. The aim of the Lord isn&rsquo;t short so he cannot save. God saves us everyday. There are situations that he saves us from that would&rsquo;ve otherwise been devastating. Have the spirit of faith.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Ephesians 3:9</strong> <strong>– And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.</strong> God has opened it up so that the body of Christ will know God.<br>
  <br>
      We must stay in Christ – no matter what happens in the world. We have the ability to bring about change. <strong>2 Chronicles 4:7</strong> <strong>– And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</strong> We have it, we must remain faithful to the calling.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Romans 8:12</strong> <strong>– Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</strong> We don&rsquo;t owe this flesh anything. Brethren – saints he&rsquo;s talking to the saints. We must remember that not everyone in the church will be lead by the spirit.<br>
  <br>
      That&rsquo;s why when Christ returns he will start with the church. When people don&rsquo;t walk by the word we show forth the love of Christ.<br>
      <br>
      We have the assignment to save those who are loss.<br>
      <br>
      You don&rsquo;t have to be a preacher to share the good news. We have to share the word. <br>
      <br>
    It&rsquo;s not our performance, it&rsquo;s what God does thru us.  </p>

    <h1>Where is Your Faith?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 1, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image6"><img src="mountains.png" width="200" height="118" alt="journey"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Where is your faith?</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 3:6, Hebrews 11:6, John 6:63, Daniel 3:27, 1 Corinthians 2:10, Galatians 3:6, James 2:14, 1 Corinthians 10:13, Matthew 17:20, Mark 9:23, Matthew 7:7, Psalm 84:11, Psalm 34:10, Philippians 4:5-6, Philippians 4:13, Isaiah 26:3, Romans 8:16-17, Mark 11:23</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Nothing will happen in your life until you use your faith. <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – </strong><strong>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> Without faith it is impossible to please God.</p>
    <p>Time does not decide our miracles; faith does. Your victory will only be realized in a renewed mind. </p>
    <p>We must discipline our thoughts and our minds. Productivity takes place in your mind before it becomes evident in your life. To get to this point we must have the God kind of faith.</p>
    <p>What you say in the midst of your circumstances determines how long you will be in it. </p>
    <p>Words are powerful <strong>John 6:63 – </strong><strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</strong> We speak the word of God into our situations. <br>
      Because we are born again believers our greatest opportunities sometimes come disguised as a problem. Don&rsquo;t view every problem as a problem. It may look like a wall in front of you, but really it&rsquo;s a door. It looks like an obstacle but really it&rsquo;s a stepping stone. </p>
    <p><strong>Daniel 3:27 – </strong><strong>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</strong> When they came out of the furnace there was no evidence that they were there. You should be able to go through problems without others knowing what you&rsquo;re going through. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:10 – </strong><strong>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</strong>  All of God promises are yes and amen. </p>
    <p>When God called Abraham where he was, he had to remove him from his father&rsquo;s house because Abraham&rsquo;s parents were idol worshippers. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 3:6 – </strong><strong>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</strong> They that are of faith are the same as Abraham&rsquo;s children. Whatever you&rsquo;re dealing with you must get into the word and quote the promise of God into your situation. </p>
    <p>We must challenge our ability. Your ability needs responsibility to expose the possibilities. </p>
    <p><strong>James 2:14 – </strong><strong>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</strong> Faith without works is dead. We walk by faith and not by sight. You must discipline your belief system. If you&rsquo;re not careful your mind will wander. We don&rsquo;t see with our eyes, we see through our eyes. <br>
      Without faith, what you see determines how you will respond.<br>
      See problems as opportunities.<br>
  <br>
      There is no excuse for disobeying God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 10:13 – </strong><strong>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</strong> Whatever you are dealing with, there is a way of escape.</p>
    <p>The attributes of God and the restored faculty of man, can be brought into existence, things that are not.<br>
       <br>
  <strong>Matthew 17:20 – </strong><strong>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</strong>  Nothing will be impossible if you have the faith, the size of a mustard seed.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark 9:23 – </strong><strong>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</strong> <em>Believe </em></p>
    <p>Faith acts like it&rsquo;s so, even when it&rsquo;s not so, that it may be so. </p>
    <p>Your words set the stage for your life. There may be times where it gets worse before it gets better. <strong>Matthew 7:7 – </strong><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</strong> Have the faith and believe.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 84:11 – </strong><strong>For the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> God is a sun and shield: the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</strong> No good thing will I withhold from you</p>
    <p>Have faith and do the right thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 34:10 – </strong><strong>The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> shall not want any good thing.</strong> Ask in faith and do right. We have to come to God with the right attitude towards God and each other. They that seek the Lord will not want any good thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:5-6 </strong><strong>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</strong><strong> 6 </strong><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Moderation = meekness, mildness, patience, kindness and gentleness to all men. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:13 – </strong><strong>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong> I can let my moderation be known to all men, no matter how they behave; because we can do all things.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 26:3 – </strong><strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:16-17 </strong>– The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>
    <p><br>
      You can prosper and be in health, but we need the right attitude.</p>
    <p>Talk expectations, not experiences.</p>
    <p>When you speak about negativity, you rehearse defeat.</p>
    <p>Have faith in God.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark 11:23 </strong>– the power of speech.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever you desire – when you pray believe and you shall receive those things.</p>
    <p>Pray the scripture back to God.</p>
    <p>Remember when you pray, Forgive!</p>

    <h1> How to Overcome False Beliefs</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 4, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image7"><img src="roses.png" width="200" height="133"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> How to Overcome False Beliefs</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 10:22, Hebrews 13:5, Hebrews 13:6, 1 John 5:14, 1 John 3:21, Psalm 27:14, Galatians 5:16, 1 Kings 3:13, Matthew 7:24, Hebrews 10:38-39, Galatians 1:6, Galatians 4:8    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>We have the assurance by God that he will do what he says he will do. The just shall live by faith. Faith is our lifestyle and foundation.</p>
    <p>Complete conviction and confidence are required. This is how we live our lives. We must overcome false belief. </p>
    <p>We have to learn how to cooperate with the plan of God in order to see our purpose. </p>
    <p>We must do what&rsquo;s pleasing in his sight.</p>
    <p>Assurance and faith are connected. <strong>Hebrews 10:22 – Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</strong> Every born again believer has a measure of faith. God-kind of faith means no matter what I see, hear or endure my faith is in God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p><strong>Cast aside doubt. </strong></p>
    <p>Go to God&rsquo;s word and say the word of God to any situation. </p>
    <p>Scriptures connect. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. </p>
    <p>The key is not to allow the thoughts of doubt, disbelief and fear to come in because they cancel out your faith.</p>
    <p>Doubt moves you away from your position in faith. If you make a faith confession – never go back and say something counter productive to what you said. </p>
    <p>We must have an assurance in adversity. <strong>Hebrews 13:6 –</strong> <strong>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</strong> If you look at, <strong>Hebrews 13:5 (Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.),</strong> it&rsquo;s the key to <strong>Hebrews 13:6. </strong></p>
    <p>When I&rsquo;m seeking a blessing, I can&rsquo;t allow myself to look at anyone else and covet what they have. <br>
      <br>
      The word of God has already told me that he can do above and abundantly more than what you want. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fear man or adversity. Fear is counterproductive to having faith. Jesus says to us not to worry. All of his promises are yes and amen. <br>
      <br>
      We have that assurance and we need the assurance; that we receive what we request, when we pray.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 5:14 – </strong><strong>And</strong><strong> this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</strong> Confidence and assurance in Christ. If we ask anything in his will, he will hear us. </p>
    <p>When you request from God you must keep in mind how your actions affect others. If what you request has a negative impact on others, you may not receive it. Have assurance in prayer. <strong>1 John 3:21 – Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</strong> We have assurance, we make our requests known, but we must keep his commandments and do what&rsquo;s pleasing to God; especially in relation to others. </p>
    <p>The assurance comes through our understanding of who God is. We must have the assurance that there will be periods where we have to wait. <strong>Psalm 27:14 – Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.</strong> While you wait maintain a good character. Don&rsquo;t get frustrated. </p>
    <p>We will have to make radical changes to do the will of God. There are times where the changes you have to make aren&rsquo;t comfortable, but I must please God, not man.</p>
    <p>Pray, seek God, walk in holiness and make radical changes. <strong>Galatians 5:16 – This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</strong> Making changes to do God&rsquo;s will requires a lifestyle that doesn&rsquo;t allow flesh and emotions to enter into our decision-making.</p>
    <p>In all our ways acknowledge him. </p>
    <p>We must obey God without full understanding. I don&rsquo;t need for God to make everything planned. </p>
    <p>Whatever God says he means. We must obey God. Obedience and love are closely connected. If you are obedient, you love.</p>
    <p>I must submit to God and to the authorities on the earthly realms. At work, you must submit yourself to authority.</p>
    <p>Christ learned obedience. Obedience and faith go together. When we obey God  - there is a reward for obedience. <strong>1 Kings 3:13</strong> <strong>– And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</strong> Walk thy way to keep they statutes – lengthen your days. </p>
    <p>Faith in God will lead you to a good old age. When you keep his commandments and honor God we don&rsquo;t do anything harmful to our bodies. We must receive what Jesus gives. We must obey God&rsquo;s word. <strong>Matthew 7:24 – Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.</strong></p>
    <p>Obey God&rsquo;s word if you want to overcome obstacles in your life. Obey his word and when the wind, rain and floods come we won&rsquo;t be washed away. Just because we&rsquo;re people of God doesn&rsquo;t mean that the flood won&rsquo;t come, it means that when the floods do come, we will be able to stand them.</p>
    <p>We must line this life of faith based on God&rsquo;s words. God teaches us the way.</p>
    <p>All other routes will end in death, if it&rsquo;s not the will of God. When we live our lives according to God&rsquo;s commandments we have the victory.</p>
    <p>Discipline yourself. Faith comes by hearing, but so can false doctrine. Be careful what you hear and what you say. Be quick to hear and slow to speak. <br>
      <br>
      Since faith comes by hearing we have to be mindful of what we hear and say. When we face trials – go to God&rsquo;s word. <br>
  <br>
      We are blessed but when we stay with God&rsquo;s word, we learn how to live.<br>
  <br>
      Be careful how you relate to coworkers, friends, family and the church congregation, this leads to prosperity. Those who travel God&rsquo;s way are blessed. <br>
  <br>
      Doubt and murmuring are traps.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow that to trap you. We must love each other, pray for each other and go into God&rsquo;s word. All our choices give an indication of who we decide to be. If you&rsquo;re not careful you make the wrong choice, consider what you&rsquo;re dong. Is this what God wants me to do? </p>
    <p>We are blessed, abundantly blessed. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 10:38-39 - Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</strong> <strong>39</strong> <strong>But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</strong> You see the consequence in not living by faith. If you are living by faith, you can&rsquo;t be a backslider. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 1:6 – I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel.</strong></p>
    <p>Our calling is very serious. If we stop we&rsquo;re not fit for the kingdom.</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 4:8 -  Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</strong> Before we were saved we had faith in things that weren&rsquo;t Godly. Once we walk by faith, to turn away puts us back in bondage. Being in bondage means that you are yielding to your flesh.</p>
    <p>We were delivered; we don&rsquo;t go back to bondage. Now we walk in holiness and righteousness. </p>
    <p>You can get into a backsliding position and end up in trouble. </p>
    <p>Walking by faith is key to our salvation, faith in Christ and blessings. We must not have faith and then put it on hold. </p>
    <p>The biggest deception is to think that you did it on your own. The flesh has a yearning to do all the things it used to before you were saved. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to know God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p>So instead of adversity taking you back to that place, it should draw you closer to God.  </p>

    <h1>Fire the Flesh</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong><span class="ui-li-aside"><img src="waterfallcascade.png" width="175" height="117" alt="Fire the Flesh"></span>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 8, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Fire the Flesh</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 5:16, Ephesians 1:3, Galatians 5:22-23, John 16, Romans 8:12-14, Proverbs 23:20, 1 Corinthians 9:27, Joshua 1:8, 1 John 4:1, Psalm 18:32, Proverbs 28:6, 1 Corinthians 15:33, </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 5:16 – This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</strong> You have to fire the flesh. The lifestyle of a believer. What do we look like to the world? A kingdom lifestyle can only be achieved when we use the power to live holy. The power to live holy is the work of the holy spirit. When people receive God at that very moment the holy spirit takes residence in their lives.</p>
    <p>He shall teach you all things and bring all things to our remembrance. We as saints of God have power. </p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t use the power, but we have it. Consider a new car with a speedometer of 180 but the driver never goes above 30 miles per hour. You have the power; why not use it.<br>
      <br>
      When we are not walking in the spirit we will fulfill the lust of the flesh. Bad attitudes and weird thoughts indicate that you are not walking in the spirit. </p>
    <p>There is no defeat when you are walking in the spirit. We can overcome any obstacle or temptation. When we are lead by the spirit all of heaven is at our disposal. <strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> <strong>– Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. </strong>Heaven is at our disposal. </p>
    <p>Walk in divine health.</p>
    <p>Our understanding of healing is far below God&rsquo;s ways. Our ways aren&rsquo;t his ways. Don&rsquo;t worry about things. When you ask God for it, be willing to accept the answer. God answers our prayers, just not in the manner that you may want it to be answered.</p>
    <p>When we receive God we receive the fruit of the spirit. <strong>Galatians 5:22-23 – But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, (23) </strong><strong>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</strong> When I&rsquo;m lead by the spirit my attitude, speech and actions demonstrate my willingness to do God&rsquo;s will and to do it immediately. </p>
    <p>We must obey God immediately because the scripture says that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. We must take delight in the agreement with God&rsquo;s law. We must meditate on the law of God.</p>
    <p>We must love the word of God. </p>
    <p>1st step is walking in the spirit – be aware of the conflicts that you&rsquo;re involved in. Negative thoughts that are nourished will produce a stronghold in your mind. Submit yourself to God – resist the devil and he will flee. This demonstrates the power that we have. </p>
    <p>We have been called to liberty. We are free. Don&rsquo;t use the freedom to do crazy things. Just because you&rsquo;re saved doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can do what you want. <br>
      <br>
      Fire the flesh. The word doesn&rsquo;t work for the carnal Christian. </p>
    <p><strong>Jeremiah 17:5</strong> – <strong>Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.</strong> You must understand the real you in Christ. Don&rsquo;t trust another man. Trust God. </p>
    <p>The real you. <strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> – <strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</strong> Your body is the temple of the holy ghost. We can&rsquo;t do whatever we want. <strong>Romans 8:12</strong> – <strong>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</strong> If you live after the flesh, you are spiritually dead. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:12-14</strong> – to walk in the spirit we need restraints. Flesh is always lusting after something. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Proverbs 23:20</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh.</strong> When someone&rsquo;s lifestyle isn&rsquo;t according to the spirit you can&rsquo;t mix with them. Whenever you spend time with them you lose your light. As saints of God, who&rsquo;ve received the power of the spirit, why do you keep going back to what you did before you were saved?</p>
    <p>Whatever you did before you were saved is still in the flesh. That&rsquo;s why some people can be in worship and praise God all day long, but if you cut them off on the road or dent their vehicle in the parking lot, another person will show up.</p>
    <p>Carnal Christians can shift. We need restrains. <strong>1 Corinthians 9:27</strong> <strong>– But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</strong> We must be disciplined – control the flesh.</p>
    <p>You need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Revelation</li>
      <li>Role model</li>
      <li>Righteous resolve without full understanding<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A student of the scripture is always learning. <strong>Joshua 1:8</strong> <strong>– This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>We can&rsquo;t treat the word of God like a buffet table. We must take the whole law of the Lord.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> <strong>– Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</strong> We need a spirit of discernment. </p>
    <p>Everybody with a robe is not preaching the gospel. You must know the word of God. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t just take anything. </p>
    <p>Be spiritually mature – we are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God. Early will I seek thee. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow anything to get in the way of your time with God.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 18:32 –</strong> <strong>It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</strong> God arms me with strength.</p>
    <p>Overcome temptations because temptation will come. </p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t go thinking we did it on our own. Don&rsquo;t be puffed up; this is a prime candidate for failure. <br>
      <br>
      With every temptation – remember that God is faithful. </p>
    <p>We need a spirit of discernment in order to make moral decisions. </p>
    <p>Will this put me in immoral company? You can&rsquo;t please everybody. You can&rsquo;t make people do anything that they don&rsquo;t want to do. You can share the truth with them, but they will do what they want. </p>
    <p>Commit it to the Lord. You don&rsquo;t have to go back and check to see how God is doing while he is working on your problems. You don&rsquo;t need to set the parameters for God.</p>
    <p>Though he slay me yet will I trust thee. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:33 – Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</strong> Be mindful of what you say. </p>
    <p>Does this violate my conscious?  We secure spiritual maturity by putting away childish things. </p>
    <p><em>You have the victory right now. You&rsquo;re an overcomer right now!</em></p>
    <p>Obey God, continually, joyfully and immediately.<br>
      <br>
      There are things that God will allow in your life that you don&rsquo;t like, but you have been ordained to fix.<br>
  <br>
      What you hate, you&rsquo;ve been sent to correct. </p>
    <p>When Jesus says we are the light of the world, we must be the light!  </p>

    <h1>How to Be Content</h1>

  <div data-role="content">
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image8"><img src="contentment.jpg" width="150" height="234" alt="How to Be Content"></div>
    <p><strong>Date: </strong>February 11, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> How to be content<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> Philippians 4:11<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Philippians 4:11, Matthew 17:20, Philippians 3:17 – 18, Philippians 3:19, Philippians 4:11, Philippians 4:6-7, Colossians 3:15, 2 Corinthians 10, Romans 8:28, Philippians 4:11, Philippians 4:8, 1 Peter 5:6-7, Colossians 3:1<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Philippians 4:11 – I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</strong> The secrets to the cure of worry. Meditate on scripture to overcome worry. Worrying doesn&rsquo;t solve anything in our lives. <br>
      <br>
      We have overcome the world. We can&rsquo;t define contentment apart from the behavior it produces. Some live in denial. Denial will always reject correction. Get out of denial.<br>
      You can&rsquo;t correct a problem if you&rsquo;re in denial. When you condone other bad behavior you&rsquo;re in denial as well. We arrive at the place of contentment by making a decision, become established in the decision and meditate on it. Confessing God&rsquo;s word gives us the power to change our focus. <br>
      <br>
      Faith coupled with confession empowers believers. <strong>Matthew 17:20 – He replied, &ldquo;Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&rdquo;</strong> We enter into this area of having faith with this scripture in mind. Making a faith confession and I won&rsquo;t be moved by circumstances and situations in my life. I&rsquo;m going to meditate on the word of God day and night.<br>
      <br>
      I&rsquo;m not going to speak about my circumstances. I&rsquo;m going to talk about the answer. If I keep talking about the problem, I&rsquo;m giving life to the problem, not to the word of God. <br>
      Never allow your circumstances to create the vision for you. Don&rsquo;t allow your problems to prophesize to you. <br>
      <br>
      When I do that I move out of the place of contentment. It requires a disciplined effort. The thoughts, emotions and actions of the flesh will have you investing in everything else, but the word of God.<br>
    <strong>There are 5 things that will pull you from your place of contentment:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Problems – If I&rsquo;m focusing on the problem, I&rsquo;m not focusing on the answer.</li>
      <li>Persecution – comes to discourage you and try to get you to give up.</li>
      <li>Passions – threatens the focus of your faith. If we allow them to become dominant in our lives it threatens our focus and purpose. It threatens how we function and how we respond to things.</li>
      <li>Pleasures that lead to sinful distractions – there are pleasures that aren&rsquo;t sinful but our participation in it leads to sinful distractions.  </li>
      <li>Situations, circumstances and associates – those who are not living godly lives aren&rsquo;t good for us because those relationships lead to sinful distractions.<strong> Philippians 3:17 – 18 – Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 18&nbsp;For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</strong> They only want to satisfy their flesh. Their minds aren&rsquo;t on living godly lives. <strong>Philippians 3:19 – Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.</strong> We should mark them and live godly lives before them to that I can continue to let my light shine. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t participate in it, no matter what it is. It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t have a relationship with them, we must set an example. <br>
      <br>
      If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can be in the spirit of contentment and relapse back into the old lifestyle. You must discipline yourself. When relapses occur, we forget about the price that was paid for us. Christ died for us. He suffered and died for us.<br>
      <br>
      Relapse occurs when we forget the misery and pain that occurred before we were saved. The old life has no joy, peace or contentment. You don&rsquo;t want to relive that. If I forget about that completely, relapse will occur. <br>
      <br>
      When we think we can live independent of God&rsquo;s word, we deceive ourselves. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:11</strong> <strong>– I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</strong> Contentment is a learned procedure. It&rsquo;s not automatic. We learn to be content through the daily problems and situations in life. It must be taught. <br>
  <br>
      When we are content – we won&rsquo;t be covetous. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what everyone else has. We don&rsquo;t covet that. <br>
      <br>
      When I&rsquo;m content – I won&rsquo;t be tested to be competitive with my brothers and sisters. If you get something new I&rsquo;m not envious or jealous. <br>
      <br>
      Before salvation we received information about what&rsquo;s right and wrong. You must ask yourself the question of who did you receive the understanding of who you are? What was their motive in telling you who you were?<br>
      <br>
      Some who tell you who you are, don&rsquo;t know who they are because they follow the worlds standards. That says in order to be important you need stuff (cars, houses) It&rsquo;s false though, because you can have all of the stuff in the world, and not be content.<br>
      <br>
      To whoever you surrender the right to define who you are, controls your destiny. They will define who you are and what you can do.<br>
      <br>
      You must know who you are. Knowing who you are gives you the keys to the kingdom. <br>
      <br>
      God made us and it&rsquo;s up to God to define how we function in life. We have a purpose – for every purpose there&rsquo;s an assignment. In order to get to contentment we must take the definition of our worth and value out of the hands of people. <br>
      <br>
    People may think they know you but they don&rsquo;t really know you. God has a plan for us.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Cure to worry:</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Philippians 4:6-7 – Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. </strong>Verse 6 is a command. Just like though shalt not…In order to get to that place of being careful for nothing, I must be content. In everything I must pray. From the smallest issue to the serious, I must pray. I can&rsquo;t worry because it solves nothing. If you worry you are borrowing troubles that can&rsquo;t be paid back. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Worrying is sinful – worry produces fear which is counter-productive  to the word of God. Every time you worry – verbalize the scripture. <strong>Philippians 4:7 - And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</strong>. Peace of God – in verse 6 we see the command – verse 7 we see the promise. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Colossians 3:15 – And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</strong> Let the peace of God rule in your heart. This verse tells us that the peace of God ruling in our heart is a choice. It is up to me. If I&rsquo;m worrying – I&rsquo;m not letting the peace of God rule. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m focusing on the problem if I&rsquo;m worrying. Renounce all worry by thanksgiving. Let your requests be known. </p>
    <p>Set your mind to be content. As a man thinketh, so is he. </p>
    <p>When the thoughts come, use your spiritual weapon. <strong>2 Corinthians 10 – (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</strong> - you have a weapon.</p>
    <p>We must stand on the word. Since this is a spiritual battle going on. It&rsquo;s a war between flesh and spirit. Circumstances and situations want you to worry and focus only on it. </p>
    <p>Our weapons aren&rsquo;t carnal. Worry, if you allow it to be a focus it will build a stronghold in your life. Tormenting over something that will likely be a blessing if it comes. There are times when blessings come disguised as a problem.<br>
      <br>
      It may look, feel and smell like a problem, but <strong>Romans 8:28 - And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</strong></p>
    <p>So even when you&rsquo;re experiencing tough times, it&rsquo;s working for my good. Words are spirit and life. Speak peace and life into circumstances. When you&rsquo;re lead by the spirit you can&rsquo;t allow circumstances to lead. You must believe in God&rsquo;s word. <strong>Philippians 4:11</strong> <strong>– Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</strong> That&rsquo;s what I learned through experiences and trials. Cast down imaginations.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow your mind to wander. Take control of your thought life. <strong>Philippians 4:8 – Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</strong> Notice that nothing negative is there. Only think on the good things. Cast down those thoughts.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about tomorrow. Those who aren&rsquo;t saved, worry about tomorrow. </p>
    <p>There are birds and animals that wake every morning and they&rsquo;re not worried. Why should I be in fear?</p>
    <p>If it snows to the door, not one sparrow will starve. That&rsquo;s the God we serve. </p>
    <p>Do you ever see a dead bird? You are a royal priesthood. A holy nation. Why are you worried.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 5:6-7 – Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</strong> <strong>7</strong> <strong>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</strong> Don&rsquo;t hold back anything. Cast all cares upon God. When I submit it to God – no matter what happens. He cares. </p>
    <p>When the thought comes to mind, remind it that you gave it to Jesus.</p>
    <p>It takes faith. We walk by faith and not by sight. Put on the whole armor of God.</p>
    <p><strong>Colossians 3:1 – If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</strong> Seek those things above. Set your affections on things above. Don&rsquo;t worry about the stuff on earth. There is no lack in our lives. There is no inefficiency in the God we serve. </p>

    <h1>Fear or Faith</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  February 15, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image9"><strong><img src="fear-or-faith.jpg" width="200" height="134" alt="Fear or Faith"></strong></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Fear or Faith</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 2 Timothy 1:6, Galatians 2:20, Psalm 103:3, Matthew 28:18, Hebrews 11:6, Luke 10:19, 1 John 4:8, Psalm 91:2, Jeremiah 1:19, 2 Corinthians 4:7, Hebrews 13:5-6</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:6 - Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 2:20 –</strong> <strong>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</strong></p>
    <p>Flesh is dead. We are no longer bound/lead by our emotions. We are grounded in the word of God. Flesh and spirit are constantly battling because the flesh always lusts after the spirit. </p>
    <p>Fear is an emotion experienced in anticipation of a danger. Fear shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of someone living for God. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. </p>
    <p>Fear shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of our character. We shouldn&rsquo;t be fearful. Stir up the gift of God. Paul was saying to Timothy that he has the power already but he had to stir it up. </p>
    <p>Because our thinking is affected by observation, association and teaching; our thinking is affected by the things we see, the people were around and the teaching we receive. Who are you? Who told you who you were? Was the teaching valid? </p>
    <p>To know this we must transform our mind. Unless the transformation occurs we live in a state of never enough. All that I need, God has already supplied. We must develop in love and faith. When we develop in those areas we have faith. </p>
    <p>What occurs in my life – I will be victorious. Whenever I&rsquo;m facing something, I must remember <strong>Psalm 103:3 – Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases. </strong></p>
    <p>Fear will cancel God&rsquo;s promises in your life. If I&rsquo;m fearful I&rsquo;m not trusting God <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> I need to please God. This is my sole objective. When pleasing God is my sole purpose, all will be given to me. </p>
    <p>Fear attacks your mental state. Fear paints a picture of you failing. We are motivated to become what we imagine ourselves to be. Fear paints a picture on the canvas of your imagination.</p>
    <p>If you accept the image of fear you are accepting a lie. What you don&rsquo;t know will affect what you believe. <strong>Matthew 28:18 – And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</strong> We have the power in heaven and earth.</p>
    <p><strong>Luke 10:19 – Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</strong> When you get an image of someone overpowering you, read <strong>Luke 10:19</strong>. Nothing will hurt you. It may come upon you, but it won&rsquo;t hurt you. </p>
    <p>God didn&rsquo;t <strong>give</strong> us a spirit of fear. Fear came from the enemy. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:8 – He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</strong> We must love. We can&rsquo;t put limitations or be selective in who we love. </p>
    <p>There are some that you shouldn&rsquo;t associate with but you can&rsquo;t hate them. We are delivered from fear. When you are in fear you create a problem by what you say out of your mouth. We must be mindful of what we receive. </p>
    <p>As overcomers we must change our conversation. <strong>Psalm 91:2 – I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. </strong>I will say of the Lord. Remember always that God is in control.</p>
    <p><strong>Jeremiah 1:19 – And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</strong> We get the mentality of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. We must speak to things in our lives. </p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re going to have struggles, but don&rsquo;t be fearful. The moment where you look like you&rsquo;re about to be defeated is when your miracle is coming.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t ask God, &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Your purpose is in you. <strong>2 Corinthians 4:7 – But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</strong> We have treasures in early vessels. </p>
    <p>We have assurance and conviction but we must have confidence. Confidence must be expressed in every believer. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t have fear and faith. My faith doesn&rsquo;t depend on a particular time-frame. </p>
    <p>When the enemy wants to do something, he puts a person in your life. When God wants to do something, he puts a person in your life. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 13:5-6 – </strong><strong>5&nbsp;</strong><strong>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6&nbsp;</strong><strong>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. We must have the confidence that whatever we pray for, we shall have. Jesus doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything else for us. </strong></p>
    <p>The Lord is my helper. I will not fear what man can do to me. You have to get your thinking around this passage. </p>
    <p>If I&rsquo;m seeking God for something I won&rsquo;t covet what others have. Be content with what you have.</p>
    <p>Be content – Because he will never leave nor forsake us. With that assurance, I can blindly say that the Lord is my helper. </p>
    <p>Every situation – the Lord is my helper.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry renounce the spirit of fear, have the confidence to believe that God will take care of everything. </p>

    <h1>A Disciplined Disciple </h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  March 9, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image11"><strong><img src="summer.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="The Believers Authority"></strong></div>
<p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> A Disciplined Disciple </p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Mark 8:35, Hebrews 12:14, Romans 13:13, Philippians 3:7, Ecclesiastes 5:10, 1 John 2, Matthew 19:29</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mark 8:35 - For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. </strong>In this Linton season – if there is something that you can give up for 40 days, why are you going back to it after the season is over?</p>
    <p>Everyday should be a day of committed living; living a life of holiness.</p>
    <p>Everyday should be a time of self-examination in order to please God. We should seek to please God daily. We should live with the expectation of his return. We don&rsquo;t know when, but we do know that the time will come. So our attitude towards God should be one of faith and love. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 12:14 – Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</strong> Pursue peace with all people not just Christians not who you choose but everyone, no matter how hard.</p>
    <p>Blessed are the peacemakers. He has called us to be holy. Be holy for I am holy. We are holy people.</p>
    <p>There are times when we are anything but holy. Whoever desires to come after God must deny themselves. Deny your sinful desires. <br>
      <br>
      The spirit man is saved but the flesh desires to commit sin. <strong>Romans 13:13</strong> <strong>– Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. </strong>Don&rsquo;t allow flesh the opportunity to sin. There are things we shouldn&rsquo;t eat and something we shouldn&rsquo;t listen to.</p>
    <p>Ask the average person what&rsquo;s the most important to them and they will tell you family, job, home. He calls us away from those things that are more than God. We must break free of trying to possess what possess you. </p>
    <p>All the money or possessions are worth nothing if Jesus isn&rsquo;t Lord in your life.</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 3:7 – But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</strong> You own is nothing unless you have God in your life. There will come a day where you will have to die; make preparations now. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ecclesiastes 5:10 – He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. </strong>You will never be satisfied with money if you love money. Even if you obtain a lot of money, it is never enough. You will never be happy because you will then get to a place where you think that people only want your money.</p>
    <p>God requires more than external words and actions. We can talk a good game. Every time you see someone with an addition or a homeless person, remember that it could have been you. Be kind. </p>
    <p>You must be willing to follow Christ. We must denounce self-dependency, self-reliance, wicked ways and anything that is contrary to the word of God. There are some people that we aren&rsquo;t supposed to associate with. The scripture says that we are to mark them. The things of the world should mean nothing to us.</p>
    <p>We must live free of the world. <strong>1 John 2 – &nbsp;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</strong> Don&rsquo;t love the things of the world. We must discipline our bodies. No matter how long you&rsquo;ve been saved. The enemy knows when you were in your mess. He tempts you with those things. </p>
    <p>What did you love most before you were saved? You must be mindful of it. You must put those things behind you.</p>
    <p>When you put things behind you God will give you such a blessing in your life, it will make you wonder why you ever wanted to do it in the first place.</p>
    <p>Self-denial should be exhibited in not pleasing ourselves. </p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 19:29 – &nbsp;And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</strong>  We must deny ourselves. The world will consistently tempt us to yield to it. </p>
    <p>Being tempted isn&rsquo;t a sin, yielding to the temptation is a sin.</p>
    <p>We must be able to handle the pressure. It will come but we must be able to handle it and be disciplined. </p>
    <p>Your greatest goal should be knowing God. I must watch my speech. Silence cannot be misquoted – don&rsquo;t say anything. You don&rsquo;t need to have the last word. Some in the grave had the last word. Just don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere you permit determines the product you receive. If you allow anger and fusion that&rsquo;s what it will produce. </p>
    <p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be sad, lonely, depressed or suffer lack as children of God.</p>
    <p>The things you worry about never happen – don&rsquo;t worry – you can&rsquo;t change </p>

    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image10"><img src="roses.jpg" width="200" height="133"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Believer&rsquo;s Authority</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Foundational Scripture – Matthew 16:19, Mark 16:15, John 4:35, Genesis 1, John 15:17, 1 Corinthians 3:10, 1 Corinthians 6:19, Ephesians 6:10, Proverbs 10:11, John 10:10, Mark 9:23, Mark 11:23 – 24, Ephesians 1:3, Hebrews 3:12,  Hebrews 3:19 <strong>    </strong>  </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 16:19 - I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be[</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23692a" title="See footnote a"><strong>a</strong></a><strong>] bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23692b" title="See footnote b"><strong>b</strong></a><strong>] loosed in heaven.&rdquo; </strong>There were different understandings as to who Jesus is. The same thing occurs today. Depending on who you ask and their circumstance – they may have different views. We know that Jesus is GOD.</p>
    <p>The church has authority in the earth realm. Why doesn&rsquo;t the church use the authority that they have in the earth realm? <strong>John 4:35 - Don&rsquo;t you have a saying, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s still four months until harvest&rsquo;? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</strong> Lift up your eyes – the fields are ripe but the laborers are few. There aren&rsquo;t that many witnesses to the gospel. There are plenty to witness to just, no one to witness. </p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s not limit ourselves to witness in the church. Hosea my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. We have to understand who we are in Christ. <strong>Matthew 16:19 - I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be[</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23692a" title="See footnote a"><strong>a</strong></a><strong>] bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23692b" title="See footnote b"><strong>b</strong></a><strong>] loosed in heaven.&rdquo; </strong>It must be lived. </p>
    <p>We are spirit beings living in a body with a soul. When our earthly house dissolves it&rsquo;s not over for us.</p>
    <p><strong>Genesis 1</strong> – When we look at the beginning of man – God said. When God said let <strong>us</strong> make man, it was the first sign of the holy trinity. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not what I can do but what Christ can do through me. Whatever he promised he will bring it to pass.</p>
    <p>If Jesus came to give us joy, we shouldn&rsquo;t be walking around like a loser. Stop singing the blues.</p>
    <p>Your system responds to what it hears. Don&rsquo;t sow bad seed into someone. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. You need to watch your mouth.</p>
    <p>The Kingdom of God is the rule and reign of God. If you are in the kingdom you are to rule. The kingdom of God resides in the saints of God. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not about religion, it&rsquo;s the relationship with God. When I acknowledge the kingdom <strong>John 15:17 - This is my command: Love each other.</strong>  I have the power of the kingdom of God. </p>
    <p>As long as my life lines up with the gospel of Christ. <strong>1 Corinthians 3:10 – By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.</strong> We are laborers with God, not for God. We are God&rsquo;s building. Since we are God&rsquo;s building, why are you putting garbage in God&rsquo;s building? Stop putting garbage in God&rsquo;s building. Don&rsquo;t put lies, malice and gossip in God&rsquo;s building. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19- Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;</strong> The Holy Spirit abides in us. Even when we mess up, the Holy Spirit stays there. Jesus said he won&rsquo;t leave us nor forsake us. If Jesus won&rsquo;t leave or forsake us, why do we forsake others when they mess up?</p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 6:9 – Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men.</strong> The Kingdom of God doesn&rsquo;t have a bunch of crazy, lazy people. Understand your positions <strong>Ephesians 6:10 - Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. </strong> You don&rsquo;t have to fight your battles. Be still. Cast your cares on him, because he cares for you. God&rsquo;s power enables us to speak with authority. </p>
    <p><strong>Proverbs 10:11 – The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. </strong>The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life. Be careful. Don&rsquo;t get to the place where your associates, circumstances and situations get you out of the will of God. </p>
    <p><strong>John 10:10 – The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</strong> Things will happen but God will give you abundant life. I have abundant peace.</p>
    <p>You have the power to bind or loose. </p>
    <p>We have unlimited power. <strong>Mark 9:23 – &ldquo;&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Jesus. &ldquo;Everything is possible for one who believes.&rdquo;</strong> Believe all things are possible. <strong>Mark 11:23 – 24 – &ldquo;Truly[</strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A23+%E2%80%93+24+&version=NIV#fen-NIV-24664a" title="See footnote a"><strong>a</strong></a><strong>] I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, &lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&rsquo; and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.</strong><strong> 24&nbsp;Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</strong> When you say it you&rsquo;re speaking faith filled words, that you believe. Unbelief is something that will cause you not to receive. He has given us all things <strong>Ephesians 1:3- Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.</strong> That&rsquo;s the good news. Don&rsquo;t receive doubtful conversations.</p>
    <p>You must see yourself victorious. You have to see yourself healed. I don&rsquo;t care how you see me. I care what God says about me.</p>
    <p>Some are hurting and want you to hurt with them. You can&rsquo;t associate with everyone. You must watch your associates.</p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 3:12 - See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</strong> <strong>Hebrews 3:19 – So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. </strong>Guard your heart. Don&rsquo;t allow negativity to remain in your heart. </p>
    <p>You can be angry but don&rsquo;t sin. If you&rsquo;re angry – say it. Don&rsquo;t let the sun go down on your wrath. </p>

    <h1>God, Turn it around</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  March 22, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image12"><img src="landscape.jpg" width="200" height="132" alt="God, Turn it around"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> God, Turn it around</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Psalm 51, Matthew 12:36 -37, Romans 14:13, Psalm 119:71, Romans 14:13, 1 John 1:7, Romans 8:28, </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>In this technology age, there is nothing that you can do without someone recording it. If you look on the spiritual side – the bible tells us that the eyes of the Lord are everywhere, so there is no hiding from God. </p>
    <p>Biblical insight on forgiveness – all of us at some point will need forgiveness because all of us at some point have sinned. All of us have wronged someone and all of us have been wronged. God, I want you to do me the same way that I do others. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.</p>
    <p>How do you forgive? Is there someone that you need to forgive? Is this the same person that you haven&rsquo;t forgiven last week or last month?</p>
    <p>When you don&rsquo;t forgive – it plants a seed of bitterness. If you hold on to that bitterness, you can take it out on someone else; someone other than the person who wronged you. </p>
    <p>Jesus says in <strong>Matthew 12:36 -37 –</strong> <strong>36&nbsp;But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.37&nbsp;For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</strong><br>
      <br>
      The Lord commands us to forgive unconditionally because whoever transgresses against you, transgresses against God. <br>
  <br>
    When you try to cover your sin – your cover will be too short. There is no hiding from God. </p>
    <p>We all want to receive forgiveness  - If we don&rsquo;t receive the forgiveness we die in our sin.</p>
    <p>Afflictions are beneficial in teaching the will of God. <strong>Psalm 119:71 –  &nbsp;It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. </strong>Time and chance comes to everyone. Your day will come when you must give an account for everything that you have said and done.</p>
    <p>We must learn forgiveness at a deeper level. Forgiveness and healing are the same. You can&rsquo;t heal unless you forgive.</p>
    <p>Judgment is prohibited. <strong>Romans 14:13 – Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</strong> Our status in the family of God is unconditional.</p>
    <p>Nothing takes you from God&rsquo;s presence, but you can take yourself out of the anointing. Jesus totally forgives. <strong>1 John 1:7 - But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</strong></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow anyone to be afraid of you or intimidated by you. <strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</strong> We want people to forgive themselves without guild. 2 reasons to forgive others – (1) we see what we are forgiven of (2) We see what we are capable of. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a lifelong commitment. Total forgiveness is a choice. It&rsquo;s not a feeling but an act of will. Choose not to keep a record of what was done to you. </p>
    <p>You can remember the wrong – but you can&rsquo;t allow yourself to re-live the pain. I remember it, but you can&rsquo;t allow yourself to re-live the pain. I remember it, but it doesn&rsquo;t take me back to the place where I used to be. </p>
    <p>Sometimes the closest people to us must be forgiven most. Refuse to punish those who deserve it. If we harbor our desire to see our enemies punished we lose the anointing of the Holy Spirit. </p>
    <p>The desire to see someone punished leaves when perfect love comes in. </p>
    <p>Just as Christ was once praised as the Savior by the same people who yelled &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo; as he hung on the cross.  We as saints of God will experience the same – We will be praised and crucified. We must forgive as we are forgiven. </p>
    <p>We not only pray for the accused, we pray for the accusers as well.<br>
      <br>
      God loves everyone the same. God wants everyone saved. There is no one beyond the peace or love of God. </p>

    <h1>Victory in Jesus</h1>

  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  March 29, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image13"><img src="island.jpg" width="200" height="150"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Victory in Jesus</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 12:1, Philippians 1:6, Ecclesiastes 9:1, Romans 6:14-15 , 1 Peter 2:11, 1 Corinthians 13:1, 1 John 3:9, 1 Corinthians 9:27, Job 8:7, Isaiah 26:3, 2 Corinthians 3:5, 1 John 2:6, Ephesians 4:32, 1 Peter 1:6-7</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong>    </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 12:1 - Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</strong> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. In the 3 verses we find words of encouragement. Chapter 12 is a carryover from Chapter 11. Hebrews Chapter 11 is called the Hall of Faith. Men and women of God dealt with trials, persecution, delays and destruction, but their faith did not fail.</p>
    <p>You will have to deal with things in life and you will need the God-kind of faith to be victorious.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We must live by faith in what God has said. Whatever translation of the bible you read, it does not change what God has already said. All of the versions of the Bible say that the wages of sin is death, but God is eternal life.</p>
    <p>To have victory, we must make the final authority in your life. God never promised us an easy flight - he promised you a safe landing.</p>
    <p>Many are the afflictions of the righteous. Living a life of righteousness is no cake walk. When you get in the word, you become a threat to Satan.</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 1:6 - Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</strong> Jesus never fails at anything, he's already started. When he hung on the cross, it was finished. Everything was complete.</p>
    <p>Don't be wary and faint in the mind. The way each day looks to you, depends on who you look to and what you are looking at.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Everything else is subject to fail, but the word of God stands forever.</p>
    <p>We know people who have overcome trials and obstacles by trusting in the Lord. Some didn&rsquo;t have degrees or even a high school diploma, but they had a relationship with God.</p>
    <p>Lay aside every weight and the sin, which easily beset us. What is that one sin that every time you look around you&rsquo;re attached to it?</p>
    <p>It may not hurt someone, but it&rsquo;s a sin. You haven&rsquo;t killed anyone but you kill their character with gossip. </p>
    <p>Lay aside old religious ways. Some are so attuned to religious order that if the spirit lead us to do something outside of the bulletin, they would be lost.</p>
    <p>The spirit moves all throughout worship service. </p>
    <p>According to his mercy, he saved us so we don&rsquo;t deserve anything. </p>
    <p>Lay aside weaknesses that hinder progress. Arrogance and attitude. A gossip will separate friends. This Christian journey that we are on, is not a race, it&rsquo;s a marathon. </p>
    <p><strong>Ecclesiastes 9:1 – For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</strong></p>
    <p>What goes around comes around. Being a disciple of Christ is demanding. Thru much tribulation, we enter God&rsquo;s kingdom. <strong>Romans 6:14-15 </strong><strong>14&nbsp;</strong><strong>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</strong><br>
      <strong>15&nbsp;</strong><strong>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Sin has consequences. Be not deceived, you will reap what you sow.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t judge others. If you spent half of the time minding your own business, and the other half leaving other&rsquo;s business alone you would be in good shape. We must pray for each other. </p>
    <p>It could happen to the best of us.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 2:11 – Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul</strong> Abstain from things that easily beset you. Anything can be sinful – it depends on the nature in which you do things. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 13:1 – Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</strong> We must make progress. You have to reach a point in your Christian walk where you don&rsquo;t do those things anymore. </p>
    <p>Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Your neighbor isn&rsquo;t going to always behave how you want them to, but if you don&rsquo;t love your neighbor, you don&rsquo;t love God.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:9 – Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</strong> Avoid sin by a new life in Christ. The holy spirit is in us. When we are lead by the spirit we don&rsquo;t commit sin. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 9:27 – But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</strong> I must control my actions. The flesh is always lusting. When you are saved your flesh continues to lust. </p>
    <p>You aren&rsquo;t under the control of the holy sprit when you are mumbling and whispering about others. When we come in the house of worship, the devil comes along too.</p>
    <p>We look to Jesus. <strong>Job 8:7 –</strong><strong> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</strong> God blesses us through obedience. Those who obey and serve him will spend their days in pleasure.</p>
    <p>Our weapons are not carnal. I don&rsquo;t need to argue with you. Sho forth the love of Christ. The love of Christ constrains us.</p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah 26:3 – Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</strong> War is in your mind. Keep your mind on god. Set your mind on Jesus, because he is the author and finisher of your faith. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 3:5 – Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</strong> Our sufficiency is of God. My strength, peace and direction, come from God. Everything that we need is wrapped up in God. </p>
    <p>Whatever state I&rsquo;m in, I&rsquo;ve learned to be content.</p>
    <p>God supplies our needs – he&rsquo;s our resource – our comfort and victory.</p>
    <p>We are redeemed from the bondage of sin, because of Christ.</p>
    <p>We must avoid sin. We must cooperate with Christ to avoid sin. God works with us. He&rsquo;s our example in servant hood, denying ourselves, persecution and affliction. He suffered. </p>
    <p>We are called to follow his example. <strong>1 John 2:6 – </strong><strong>6&nbsp;He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</strong></p>
    <p>How did Jesus walk? When he was reviled, he reviled not. When he was beaten, persecuted, spat on, he said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 4:32 – And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</strong> Forgive as God forgives us. If God didn&rsquo;t love us as much as he does. If he forgive us like we forgive others, we&rsquo;d be in trouble.</p>
    <p>Run with patience, the race that&rsquo;s set before us.</p>
    <p>Have patience, the race that&rsquo;s set before us.</p>
    <p>Have patience with people. Is there anyone that you don&rsquo;t have patience with?</p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 13 – And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</strong> Your faith will be tested. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 1:6-7 – </strong><strong>6&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</strong><br>
      <strong>7&nbsp;</strong><strong>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</strong> The trial of your faith will be your glory when Christ comes back. The word purifies us. </p>
    <p>Once you get God&rsquo;s word in your spirit, you can&rsquo;t stand around and hear foolishness. You cant listen to someone lying on someone else.</p>
    <p>We have to look to Jesus – looking to Jesus requires abiding in his teaching. You must stay in the word.</p>
    <p>Spend time with God. Spend more time with God than others, because spending time with God allows us to spend time with others.</p>
    <p>Everyday repeat, &ldquo;Father, I thank you for this day&rsquo;s grace!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Thank you, God for this moment!</p>

    <h1>Because He Lives</h1>

  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  April 5, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image14"><img src="meghansbay.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Because He Lives"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Because He Lives</p>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:  </strong>1 Corinthians 15:20 - But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept<strong>.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Romans 5:10, John 2:19, Acts 2:22, Psalm 51:5, 1 Corinthians 15:17, Ephesians 2:11 – 13, Philippians 4:11, 2 Timothy 2:11, John 1:12, 1 John 3:8, Galatians 5:22</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong>    </p>
    <p>Today we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is the foundation of our faith. Christ died, Christ has risen, Christ will come again. </p>
    <p>There has to be preparation to receive him. Without preparation, man will be eternally lost. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:10 – For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</strong> We must confess and have the faith to believe and then we&rsquo;ll be saved. When we confess Christ as our Lord and Savior. We aren&rsquo;t saved from the presence of sin, but from the power of sin. Sin has no power over us.</p>
    <p>The spiritual man must be fed. We feed the natural man but we must also feed the spiritual man. <strong>John 2:19 – </strong><strong>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</strong> The resurrection proves the power of God. <strong>Acts 2:22 – </strong><strong>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</strong> Jesus is our life. </p>
    <p>Every person born since Adam was born in the bondage of sin. Since the first man sinned, sin was transferred to every being. <strong>Psalm 51:5 – </strong><strong>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</strong> We were conceived in sin. </p>
    <p>For as in Adam all died even as in Christ all shall be made alive.</p>
    <p>The first man was born without sin but when he sinned the fellowship was broken.</p>
    <p>They sacrificed animals to cover their sin, but it wouldn&rsquo;t remove their sin. </p>
    <p>God wasn&rsquo;t surprised when Adam sinned. God is not surprised when we sin. </p>
    <p>Resurrection is the answer to Adam&rsquo;s sin. <strong>1 Corinthians 15:17 –  </strong><strong>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</strong> If Jesus wasn&rsquo;t raised from the dead everything we do is in vain. </p>
    <p>Christ came, died and rose again so we could have eternal life. When you sin or transgress don&rsquo;t feel like you need to be saved again. The righteous acts of God set us free, forever. </p>
    <p>Christ was the perfect sacrifice. <strong>Ephesians 2:11 – 13 – </strong><strong>11</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</strong><br>
      <strong>12</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: </strong><strong>13</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</strong></p>
    <p>Remember when you had no hope. When you had to create joy and peace in your life. This was before you had a relationship with Christ.</p>
    <p>On the cross, Christ took on the sins of the world. God isn&rsquo;t tied up in the mindset of what is and isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
    <p>God is almighty!</p>
    <p>God was involved in the resurrection. It was the Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. </p>
    <p>The same spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in us. We are never alone or without God in our lives. Our standing in Christ is secure. Our state in Christ is progressive.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re not at the same level everyday. <strong>Philippians 4:11–</strong><strong> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</strong> Whatever state I&rsquo;m in, I&rsquo;ve learned to be content.</p>
    <p>Be angry and sin not! Don&rsquo;t let the sun go down on your wrath. Don&rsquo;t hold it in. The Holy Spirit quickens us.</p>
    <p>The resurrection of Christ was necessary. Our faith is in the preaching of Christ. Our salvation is based in the belief in God&rsquo;s word. <br>
      <br>
      If there was no resurrection we would be wasting our time in church. All of our witnesses would be liars. We would be miserable people, because we would have faith in something that doesn&rsquo;t exist. When the trumpet sounds the dead in Christ will rise first. </p>
    <p>Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the works of the Lord. </p>
    <p>All the Saints wont be dead when Christ returns. In a moment it will change. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:11 – It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</strong> We are saved to a relationship with Christ. </p>
    <p><strong>John 1:12 – But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name</strong> We make the faith confession to receive salvation.<br>
      <br>
      We must change from just coming to church to be the church. If you are saved, you are the church.<br>
  <br>
      We are the church – we go to the building to meet, but we are the church. </p>
    <p>The resurrection demonstrates victory over spiritual forces – the enemy has no power over you. The enemy doesn&rsquo;t respond to verbiage, he responds to knowledge.</p>
    <p>You have to know what&rsquo;s written. We need a relationship with Jesus. Church membership isn&rsquo;t as important as the knowledge of Christ. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:8 – He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</strong> The works of the devil was destroyed already. Satan has no power over you. He comes with temptations and suggestions. Cast down those negative thoughts. We have been delivered. Satan has no power. </p>
    <p>We have the keys to death, life and the grave. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose here will be loosed in heaven.</p>
    <p>When you speak doubt it reinforces your conversation. We have peace with God. We already have peace and joy. <strong>Galatians 5:22 – </strong><strong>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</strong> We have the power. </p>

    <p><strong>Bible Study:</strong> Perseverance<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> Philippians 4:11<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 2:6-7, 1 Corinthians 15:57, Romans 12:13, James 1:2, 1 Corinthians 13:7, Psalms 119:9-11, 2 Corinthians 10:5, Psalm 141:3, Ephesians 4:22, Romans 13:13, Romans 5:2, Romans 8:28, Ephesians 6:10<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      Perseverance is enduring a course of action or belief. The definition of perseverance is a continuing commitment to the Gospel of Christ. At times we are weary, tired, sad, wondering if we are doing the right thing. We must persevere during these times.<br>
      <br>
      The enemy comes and tells you that God doesn&rsquo;t care about you. Especially during the times when others are receiving blessings all around you. This is the time when you need to persevere. <br>
      Christians persevere in faith. Hang on to the word. Whatever God says. <strong>Galatians 2:6-7 - But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</strong><br>
      <strong>7&nbsp;But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter</strong><strong></strong><br>
      When we receive Christ our actions should be in Christ. We must be built up in Christ. We must be steadfast and unmovable. <strong>1 Corinthians 15:57 – But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong>Don&rsquo;t allow the things that happen in your life to diminish your faith in God. God is the same yesterday, today and forever more. Never move away from what you know.<br>
      <br>
      When we pray <strong>Romans 12:13 - Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</strong>  We persevere in prayer. When we have trials in our lives we must be patient. We must stay with God. Don&rsquo;t look at what&rsquo;s seen, remember the promise. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>James 1:2 – My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</strong> Count it all joy – When these things happen don&rsquo;t let it steal your joy. Trying of your faith worketh patience. <br>
      Perseverance arises from suffering. There is a lesson in everything. We learn more about God when we have to deal with things. Sickness, trials and troubles than I do by reading scripture. The trials allows the word to become alive in your life.<br>
      <br>
      We get to a place where we know that what God&rsquo;s promised has come to pass. I read it in the scripture but experiencing it makes it a greater reality.<br>
      Perseverance demonstrates Christian character. It builds Christian character. We become witnesses after our suffering. Others can see God in you. Since we are witnesses, we shouldn&rsquo;t hide it.<br>
      God gets the glory. When our character is demonstrated. <strong>1 Corinthians 13:7 – Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. </strong>I can endure all things because I belong to him.<br>
      He promised to keep us, so I can bear all things. He didn&rsquo;t promise no disappointment, pain or sadness. Weeping endures for a night. With that knowledge we can rejoice. <br>
      We are encouraged to persevere. To hold fast to our faith. To stand – we don&rsquo;t give up. <br>
      <br>
      The temptation may come but we don&rsquo;t give in to the temptation. We are encouraged as Christians to persevere. We know that at the appointed time, God will do what he said he would do.<br>
      Not our time – God&rsquo;s time. God knows the best time. He delivers us, he heals us and he supplies our needs. So we trust in God. The Bible tells us don&rsquo;t put trust in man, trust in God. He made us, not us, ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      God&rsquo;s all knowing, all-faithful and all-powerful, put your trust in God.<br>
      <br>
      We must also discipline ourselves. To be disciplined is to be of a mindset and attitude that no matter what happens, we wait. A lot of times it&rsquo;s not easy; because when you wait for God there are thoughts and things that come in our lives. <br>
      <br>
      Maybe, I should do this or that. No! You need to wait. You don&rsquo;t sit and wait, you serve while you wait. <br>
      <br>
      We have to use self-discipline, even when we study the word. When we study the word, we learn what to do with every situation that arises in our lives. <br>
      <strong>Psalms 119:9-11 – 9&nbsp;Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</strong><br>
      <strong>10&nbsp;With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>11&nbsp;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <br>
      When you study the word, you will find that when you need a scripture, it comes to remembrance. The holy spirit reveals it to us.<br>
      If I&rsquo;m going to persevere I must have a disciplined mind. I cant let my mind wander. <strong>2 Corinthians 10:5 – Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</strong><br>
      <br>
      Trouble will come, so will contrary thoughts .You must replace those crazy thoughts with the word of God. Sometimes you must replace the words of others with the word of God.<br>
      In perseverance we get very tired but if God is saying wait, I must wait until I get an answer from God. I can&rsquo;t move until then. When you aren&rsquo;t sure, have a conversation with Jesus. Especially while you&rsquo;re persevering. <br>
      <br>
      We must also discipline our speech. Cast down those thoughts before you say it. Thoughts become words, words become actions and actions paint our destiny.<br>
      <strong>Psalm 141:3 – Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. </strong>Don&rsquo;t let me say things I shouldn&rsquo;t say. Put a watch over my mouth. Don&rsquo;t let me question that which you set before me.<br>
      Discipline our speech and discipline our behavior. We must discipline our bodies. <strong>Ephesians 4:22 – That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts</strong> put off the old man. <br>
      <br>
      Perseverance is required during trials but I can&rsquo;t go back and say the things I used to say concerning the trial.<br>
      We must discipline our bodies. <br>
      <br>
      Self-discipline – If I discipline myself, it prevents God&rsquo;s discipline. <strong>1 Corinthians 11:32-33 - 32&nbsp;But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</strong><br>
      <strong>33&nbsp;Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong> If I discipline myself – God doesn&rsquo;t have to discipline me. </strong><br>
      <br>
      Refrain from saying things that are contrary to the life I should be living. There&rsquo;s a blessing for us when we discipline ourselves. God rewards us.<br>
      <br>
      Failure can&rsquo;t happen in your life without permission. We can&rsquo;t complain about the things we permit in our lives. When you allow it to happen, don&rsquo;t complain.<br>
      <br>
      When dealing with situations you must adjust any contrary argument. Anything telling us not to obey God – we don&rsquo;t need. We must obey God – even when it appears to not be working, we must obey God. <strong>Romans 13:13 – Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</strong> I can&rsquo;t give the flesh the opportunity to sin. Walking in the spirit conquers the flesh.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Keys to Perseverance</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-control over the spirit</li>
      <li>Self- Denial</li>
      <li>Self-Control</li>
      <li>Make no provisions for the flesh</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We must keep ourselves pure. Failure for us is not an option. Whenever we are faced with something expect God to do what he said. Remember that God always gives his people the best. <br>
      It doesn&rsquo;t mean we won&rsquo;t have trials but God wants the very best for us.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Things – We are justified through Christ and we have peace</strong><br>
  <strong>Romans 5:2 – By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. </strong>We must glory in tribulation, because tribulation worketh patience and patience worketh experience and experience, hope. Glory in tribulation because without it our patience wouldn&rsquo;t exist.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. </strong>We look for the greater good. Knowing this we can still rejoice in our need and tribulation. I can still give God glory. Even when things aren&rsquo;t going right – glory in tribulation.<br>
  <br>
      There are some things that you deal with that you can praise your way out of never get to the place where you lose your praise.<br>
      <br>
      We are more than a conqueror. Before tribulation comes we have the information before hand – so the tribulation is defeated.<br>
      <br>
      Christ said it is finished. Since Christ is the victor and we are in him we are victorious. When we are weak, we&rsquo;re strong because of Christ. Not physical strength but spiritual strength.<br>
  <strong>Ephesians 6:10 – Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. </strong>Be strong in the Lord. Because he loves us, I&rsquo;m more than a conqueror. We are winners before the battle starts. Before the next incident come up we are more than a conqueror. When you look at a conqueror, remember that you are more than that. <br>
  <strong>1 Peter 4:16 – Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. </strong> Don&rsquo;t be ashamed, glorify God in your suffering. <br>
      Perseverance – The trial won&rsquo;t last.<br>
      <br>
      My grace is sufficient. We are strongest when we are weak. Give God the glory in your trial and the power of God will rest on you.<br>
      <br>
      The power belongs to God. If it doesn&rsquo;t change tomorrow all power belongs to God. There is never a time when God isn&rsquo;t faithful. <br>
      <br>
      I&rsquo;m persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      When you&rsquo;re going through, remember that this isn&rsquo;t the end. I&rsquo;m going on from here. It&rsquo;s not over. <br>
      <br>
      Look at life like it&rsquo;s a boxing match. <br>
      <br>
      You can remind God – talk to him.<br>
      <br>
      God has called us all for something special – we can&rsquo;t just sit around. Get up.<br>
      <br>
      God has already got the victory – so we need not fear anything. Walk in faith. This is what he promised me. This will happen. When you are feeling fearful – Stand in Faith!</p>

<p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Secret to Abundant Life</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackbirddetectiveseries.com/sermons/Tracko1.cda" target="new">Play Sermon</a></p>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:  </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 8:32, John 8:32, Joshua 1:8, 2 Chronicles 7:15, 1 Peter 2:9, John 15:4-5, Ephesians 6:17, Psalm 19:7-14, Psalm 199:33, Psalm 91:11, Job 36:11, 1 John 4:9, 1 John 4:4, Matthew 6:33, 2 Corinthians 4:15, Romans 8:28, Proverbs 10:32</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>God knows what we&rsquo;re thinking before the thought enters our mind. How much do you love God? How much do you trust God? How much will you obey his word? As much as you trust and obey his word is how much you love him. </p>
    <p><strong>John 8:32 – And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</strong> The truth will make you free. You&rsquo;ll know the truth if you continue in his word. </p>
    <p>The word of truth, produces faith. While prayer is the best way to talk to God, meditation is the best way to hear from God.</p>
    <p><strong>Joshua 1:8 – This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</strong> Meditate on the word, day and night. When you meditate on the word you will be prosperous. We must meditate on the word. It&rsquo;s food for saints.</p>
    <p>Meditating on the word helps you see your position and power in Christ. You must humble yourself in prayer.<strong> 2 Chronicles 7:15 – Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</strong> Pray. </p>
    <p>God looks at our heart. We as the saints of God can be judgmental.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t judge someone else and have abundant life. Your purpose in life is greater than your existence.</p>
    <p>You were created in the image and likeness of God. God isn&rsquo;t trying to make you into something. He wants to expose who you are. </p>
    <p>He&rsquo;s trying to expose you, <strong>1 Peter 2:9 – But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;</strong> To receive information, I must meditate on God&rsquo;s word. <br>
      <strong>John 15:4-5 – 4&nbsp;Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 5&nbsp;I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Without Jesus we can&rsquo;t do anything. Sometimes the enemy will trick us into opening our mouths. We are made in the image of what we desire. </p>
    <p>Desire the sincere milk of the word.<strong> Jeremiah 15:16 – Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God of hosts.</strong> The word of God challenges us. Ephesians 6:17 – You need the sword of the spirit. I can love you even when you curse me, because of the word. </p>
    <p>The word of God changes us. <strong>Psalm 19:7-14 – </strong><strong>7&nbsp;</strong><strong>The law of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>is sure, making wise the simple.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>8&nbsp;</strong><strong>The statutes of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>is pure, enlightening the eyes.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>9&nbsp;</strong><strong>The fear of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>are true and righteous altogether.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>10&nbsp;</strong><strong>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>11&nbsp;</strong><strong>Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>12&nbsp;</strong><strong>Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>13&nbsp;</strong><strong>Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <strong>14&nbsp;</strong><strong>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong>, my strength, and my redeemer.</strong><br>
      I have to love and long for the word.</p>
    <p>We are new creatures in Christ, dwelling in this old body. The old man is still there. That&rsquo;s why Christians get frustrated and curse.</p>
    <p>Order my steps in your word. Let not iniquity have dominion in me. </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 91:11 – For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</strong> He will give Angels charge over you to keep you in your ways. God never advances you beyond your last act of disobedience. </p>
    <p>When you were in your deepest sin, God knew you and ordained you with an assignment. </p>
    <p>If we obey and serve him we will spend our days in prosperity. If you obey and serve him, you don&rsquo;t have to wait on publishers clearing house or the lottery. <strong>Job 36:11 - If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</strong></p>
    <p>You have abundant life now. Abundant life isn&rsquo;t tied up in things. You can get things on your own, without consulting God, but there is a consequence. This is how people end up in massive debt. </p>
    <p>Failure cannot happen in your life without your permission. You are designed to succeed. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:9 - In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
      </strong><br>
      <strong>1 John 4:4 – Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</strong> Greater is he that is in you. If greater is he that is in you why are you worried about he that is in the world?</p>
    <p>Set yourself – discipline your thought life. Thoughts become words, words become actions, and actions become your habits. The thing you think about the most is what you end up doing. </p>
    <p>We decide our habits and our habits decide our future.</p>
    <p>You will never possess what you are unwilling to pursue.</p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 6:33 – But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</strong> You must seek the kingdom first.</p>
    <p>You must know how to handle pressure to operate in this abundant life. Pressure will come but to overcome it you must be able to handle pressure.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 4:15- For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</strong> All things work together for good.</p>
    <p>There are times when it may not look good, but because I love God and I am called to his purpose it&rsquo;s working for my good. </p>
    <p>All things!</p>
    <p>We must get to the place in Christ where we stop running to God about our problems. There are some times when you need to tell your problems about your God. </p>
    <p>Proverbs 10:32 – The righteous aren&rsquo;t going around saying craziness. We are winners right now!</p>

    <h1>Prayer – How to Pray </h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Bible Study:</strong> Prayer – How to Pray </p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image16"><img src="prayer.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113"></div>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:</strong> Mark 11:23<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Philippians 4:13, Isaiah 55:11, Isaiah 41:10, Ephesians 1:3, Hebrews 11:6, Psalms 33:9, Hebrews 11:3, 1 John 4:17, Philippians 4:13<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Mark 11:23 - For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><br>
      Make sure that what you say is in alignment with what God says. <strong>Philippians 4:13 – I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong> God will supply all of your needs – not only material, but emotional. I have the God kind of peace.</p>
    <p><br>
      Faith without works is dead so no matter what happens I have faith. Worry contaminates faith. You can&rsquo;t believe God and be afraid. </p>
    <p><br>
      All scripture is inspired by God so I must know the scripture. Throw up your hands in praise not in frustration.<br>
      <br>
      The enemy brings the spirit of frustration and doubt in an effort to change your testimony from I know God can to I don&rsquo;t think God will.<br>
      There are principles that must operate the same. God will not go back on his word. Pray but don&rsquo;t doubt. Doubt says that you don&rsquo;t believe in what God said. <br>
      We must be rooted and grounded in the word. Pressure will come to change your testimony.<br>
      <br>
      When you we experiencing pressure you need to be able to handle it. You handle pressure by rehearsing the word of God. <br>
      Wait on the Lord and be of good courage. Don&rsquo;t lose your joy in the midst of circumstance.<br>
      <br>
      It can&rsquo;t last. This too shall pass. My condition can&rsquo;t outlast what God says – heaven and earth will pass, but my word. <strong>Isaiah 55:11 – So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</strong> Stand on what I said because it won&rsquo;t come back to me without the results that were intended. <br>
      <br>
      Discipline your speech, cast down negativity. Anything that comes against what I know, I cast down.<br>
      We are in spiritual warfare. You are a part of it. It&rsquo;s up to us to will or lose. God has already given us what we need to win.<br>
      When you are in a bad situation and it looks bleak think of what he has already done.<br>
      <br>
      He never change. If he heated once he&rsquo;ll heal me again. Look at his record and verbalize it. I don&rsquo;t allow the pain to contaminate my faith or change my testimony.<br>
      Words are key to our victory. Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Watch your mouth. God won&rsquo;t do anything contrary to his word. <br>
      <br>
      We must have confidence in God. Confidence in God&rsquo;s presence. <strong>Isaiah 41:10 – Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. We </strong>need confidence in his presence that he won&rsquo;t leave nor forsake you. Never allow the thoughts to come to your mind that God forgot you. We must be mindful when were around others. <br>
      <br>
      When you&rsquo;re alone we must discipline our minds to wander to places of defeat! It&rsquo;s already done. Your answer, what you&rsquo;re about to receive is already in the spirit realm. All you need is already done. <strong>Ephesians 1:3 – Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.</strong> When it&rsquo;s time to pray there are some things that you must do. We need to get into an attitude of prayer and then remove yourself from distraction.<br>
      <br>
      Find a place where you can meet God. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be a private room, but we must pray in secret. God who sees you pray in secret rewards you openly. Then you must have faith.<br>
      <br>
      Believe in the power and glory of God. Don&rsquo;t wait for the result to praise him. Give him the glory.<br>
      <br>
      God is worthy to be praised. Remain in the anointing. Be able to pray at a moment&rsquo;s notice. <br>
      <br>
      Even when dealing with something – your character shows that you know Jesus. We honor the Lord by reflecting his character and nature. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</strong> When you pray you must believe. <br>
      <br>
      It&rsquo;s almost like child-like prayer. When you tell a child something they believe it without wondering.<br>
      <br>
      If you ask without doubting you&rsquo;ll have whatever you seek.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t let anxiety and fear separate you from God&rsquo;s promise.<br>
      <br>
      You can look around you and see others that God answered their prayers. I know that he&rsquo;s able to do it for me. <br>
      <br>
      Negative faith and positive faith come by the same means, by hearing. What we listen to and what we believe are our sources of faith.<br>
      I&rsquo;ve got to have the God-kind of faith to believe God&rsquo;s word. <br>
      <br>
      Negative faith comes from hearing. We are created to operate under the same faith as God does. Say what God says. <strong>Psalms 33:9 – For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.</strong> God created by believing in the reality.<br>
      <br>
      When we fail to say what God says – we are rehearsing failure because it won&rsquo;t work.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 11:3 – </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</strong> When God created, he said let there be light.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 John 4:17 – Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</strong> God created everything but words. We are the same as Christ in this world. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> <strong>–  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong> We can do all things through Christ – we must take literally because what I do will align with God&rsquo;s word. <br>
      Christ won&rsquo;t strengthen me to do things that don&rsquo;t line up with Christ.<br>
      <br>
      Begin to say it over and over. As saints you must be willing to look ridiculous in this world for Christ. The world will call you crazy but they don&rsquo;t understand.<br>
      When you ask for something on, speak about it as if it&rsquo;s already done.<br>
      <br>
      Thank God for it – praise him for supplying our needs.<br>
      <br>
      When you lose something promised to you, you can get it back by using your faith.<br>
      <br>
      Move as if it&rsquo;s already done.<br>
      <br>
      Speak the word of faith.<br>
      <br>
      Watch what you receive – faith comes by hearing.<br>
      <br>
      When you watch television or listen to the radio it&rsquo;s faith – you&rsquo;re hearing it, it&rsquo;s sowing into your spirit.<br>
      <br>
      Everything that comes into your spirit comes through the ear gate and the eye gate.<br>
      <br>
      What you say is a reflection of what&rsquo;s in, your heart. We create our world the same way God did – with our words.<br>
      <br>
      When we pray the prayer of faith we ask and see it because it&rsquo;s in the spirit world. Don&rsquo;t doubt when you self-doubt. You preach yourself out of it.<br>
      <br>
      We need to have right relationships with each other. In order for our prayers to manifest there must be a spirit of forgiveness and brotherly kindness.</p>

    <h1>Keys to Effective Prayer</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  April 19, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image18"><img src="matthew.jpg" width="200" height="165"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Keys to Effective Prayer</p>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:  </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 10:19-22, Ephesians 3:12, Psalm 42:1-2, Psalm 63:1, 1 John 5:14, Romans 8:26-27, Philippians 4:9, Isaiah 26:3, Psalm 66:18, Matthew 5:23-24, Matthew 5:9, Proverbs 21:13, Luke 6:38, Matthew 15:7-9, 1 John 1:22, James 1:16</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With a title like, &ldquo;Keys to Effective Prayer&rdquo; there must be ineffective prayer. Through his grace, God gives us things that we don&rsquo;t deserve. God shields us from the things we deserve. When justice would have its way, God shields us. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 10:19-22 - 19&nbsp;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20&nbsp;By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21&nbsp;And having an high priest over the house of God; 22&nbsp;Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Because of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross we have all that we need. Let us draw near with a true heart of full assurance of faith.  </strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ephesians 3:12 – In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. </strong>We have confidence. Come boldly to the throne. Prayers should reflect a longing for God.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 42:1-2 – 42&nbsp;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 2&nbsp;My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</strong><br>
      My soul thirsts for God. We should have a longing to have a conversation with God before facing the world. <strong>Psalm 63:1 – O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</strong> Early do I seek thee. <br>
  <br>
      The true motive for prayer is to honor God&rsquo;s name. To his name goes all the glory. He is faithful. We must come to God with the right motives.<br>
  <br>
      God answers prayers according to his will. <strong>1 John 5:14 – And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</strong> If I ask according to his will he hears us. There is a law of God&rsquo;s will. His word is his will. If you follow in his will you don&rsquo;t have to worry. <strong>Romans 8:26-27 – 26&nbsp;Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27&nbsp;And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</strong><br>
      The Holy Spirit makes intersessions for us. Sometimes we pray and don&rsquo;t know what we are praying for, but the spirit intercedes for the saints.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the character of a person of prayer? Peace with God, peace with myself and peace with others. <strong>Philippians 4:9 – Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. </strong>You must learn, receive and study the word. </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve got peace with God and I have the peace of God. If I have the peace of God, I don&rsquo;t have to worry. Because I&rsquo;m asking according to his will, I&rsquo;m not asking God to hurt my enemy.</p>
    <p>The peace of God comes when you keep your mind on God. Isaiah 26:3 – When you keep your mind on God, your relationships must be right in order to have your prayers answered. <strong>Psalm 66:18 - If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</strong> If I don&rsquo;t have peace with you, God won&rsquo;t hear or answer me. </p>
    <p>No matter how hard I pray, the Lord doesn&rsquo;t hear me. The Lords hand is not short, your iniquity has separated you from him. When you are in a state of sin it separates you from God. </p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 5:23-24 - 23&nbsp;Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 24&nbsp;Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</strong> It&rsquo;s your responsibility to make it right. God won&rsquo;t accept your gift until you&rsquo;re reconciled with others </p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 5:9 – Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. </strong>The peacemaker – those who make it right when there is a problem with a brother. Even if they wronged you. You make sure that the relationship is renewed and everything is in  order. We need peace with others. </p>
    <p>If you see someone in need and you are able to help, but don&rsquo;t God won&rsquo;t hear your prayers. </p>
    <p><strong>Proverbs 21:13 – Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. </strong> If I don&rsquo;t hear the cry of the poor, God won&rsquo;t hear me. Freely ye have received, freely give. </p>
    <p><strong>Luke 6:38 – Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. </strong> If you release what&rsquo;s in your hand, God releases what&rsquo;s in his hand and his hand is bigger than ours. </p>
    <p>Reverence, humility, honesty without hypocrisy. <strong>Matthew 15:7-9 - 7&nbsp;Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 8&nbsp;This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 9&nbsp;But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</strong><br>
       God knows when your heart isn&rsquo;t in worship. He is a searcher of hearts.</p>
    <p>God answers the prayers of obedient people. Keep his commandments, do what&rsquo;s pleasing in his sight. Everything I do must please God or he won&rsquo;t answer your prayers. <br>
      <br>
      We must utilize these keys if we want our prayers answered. </p>
    <p><strong>James 1:16 – Do not err, my beloved brethren. </strong>Confess your faults. That&rsquo;s the character of a holy man or woman. Praise God for the things he has done, the things he will do and the things you have done.</p>
    <p>When you pray, believe.</p>
    <p>There will be times when we don&rsquo;t receive what we ask for, but he puts us in the classroom of struggle to teach us lesson.</p>
    <p>When you approach situations the Holy Spirit speaks to us.</p>
    <p>God gave us 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason. Be quick to hear and slow to speak. Pray, but don&rsquo;t talk so much.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t go to God with a list of things; just thank him for what he has done. </p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Lifestyle of a Born Again Believer</p>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:  </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Galatians 5:22, Ephesians 4:11-12, 1 Corinthians 13:13, Ephesians 5:2 <br>
      Acts 1:8, 1 John 3:17-18, Philippians 4:11, Psalm 119:27 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When we look at the attributes of a believer, every born again believer has the Holy Spirit and also the gifts of the spirit. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. Since Christ abides in us. <strong>Galatians 5:22 - But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.</strong></p>
    <p>Every born-again believer has gifts for the building up of the church. Ephesians 4:8 – and <strong>Ephesians 4:11-12</strong> <strong>– So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12&nbsp;to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.</strong> Everyone doesn&rsquo;t have the same gift. Our gifts aren&rsquo;t for our glory it&rsquo;s for the building up and edification of the church. </p>
    <p>The fruit of the spirit produces completely, no matter how faint the evidence may be. We can all demonstrate the fruit of love. </p>
    <p>The fruit could be in you and you may not be a loveable person, God prunes us to make us loveable and loving people. </p>
    <p>Agape love is an unconditional love. No matter who, where or what you&rsquo;ve done – you&rsquo;re loved. </p>
    <p>Winning souls to Christ – We are to go and share the good news with everyone you come in contact with. </p>
    <p>We are the church. The building is where we pray. The church is where I am. I&rsquo;m the church with a testimony and a witness. I have to study in order to gain an increase. </p>
    <p>Action fruit – loving people – comes from attitude fruit. What is your attitude?</p>
    <p>Nine Characteristics of Godly fruit is produced in us by the Holy Spirit. The love of Christ dwells in us and is produced by the Holy Spirit. </p>
    <p>Love and self-control – once you get those 2 straight you can deal with anything.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t have love, you have no patience. If you don&rsquo;t have you have no self-control. When love isn&rsquo;t evident in your life you lose control.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 13:13</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</strong> Love, hope, charity, neighbor goes beyond the person next door and it also goes beyond that person behaving properly. This is a command not an option. </p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 5:2</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</strong> Walk in love.</p>
    <p><strong>Acts 1:8</strong> <strong>– But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo;</strong> We have the power to love one another. </p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t say that we can&rsquo;t love someone and then in the next breath say, &ldquo;I can do all things through Christ&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>Our behavior and attitude should reflect Christ because we are led by the spirit.</p>
    <p>Agape love seeks out only the good in others. </p>
    <p>Your ability to deal with adversity could change the hearts and minds of others.</p>
    <p>God&rsquo;s love is manifested in deeds. I don&rsquo;t just say I love you, I show it.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:17-18</strong> <strong>–  </strong><strong>If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?</strong><strong> 18&nbsp;Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</strong> Let us not love in word and tongue, but in deeds. <br>
      <br>
      The source of the spiritual fruit is the acceptance of the gospel. All things have become new and all things are of God. <br>
  <br>
      We need the same mindset that&rsquo;s in God. We must abide in him. </p>
    <p>We need to study the word. </p>
    <p>He will keep us in perfect peace because our minds are stayed on him.</p>
    <p>Not only do we grow in love – we grow in understanding. <strong>Psalm 119:27 – </strong><strong>Cause me to understand the way of your precepts,</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds. </strong> Lord make me understand. That&rsquo;s why the Holy Spirit teaches us. We need to grow in contentment. </p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:11 – I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</strong> I&rsquo;m led by the spirit so I don&rsquo;t go ahead of God.</p>
    <p>What is it that comes into my life to make me lose control?</p>
    <p>What causes you to lose control of your tongue?</p>
    <p>Put a watch over my mouth. Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. </p>

      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Isaiah 55:10-11, 2 Corinthians 9:10, Jeremiah 1:12, Hebrews 11:6, Mark 11:22, 2 Corinthians 5:14, Psalm 34:1, Matthew 6:30-31, Isaiah 40:31, Isaiah 40, Philippians 4:6, Psalm 91:14-15, Jeremiah 33:3, Psalm 4:3 <br>
      <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Knowing How to Pray the Prayer of Faith</p>
    <p><br>
    <strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      All of the blessings of God are already ours; we need information in order to access the power. <br>
      <br>
      Speaking faith filled words brings us a blessing. We must be mindful of fear and doubt. Fear and doubt must be mindful. Never let outward circumstances to change our inner convictions. Can&rsquo;t let situations remove us from the word of God.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Isaiah 55:10-11 – </strong><strong>10&nbsp;</strong><strong>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>11&nbsp;</strong><strong>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</strong><strong></strong><br>
  <br>
      The word will work when we work the word. We only need to believe. A believer acts on the word of God. The word of God is a seed. We saw that seed into our circumstances situations.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 9:10 – Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</strong> We are the righteousness of God. <strong>Jeremiah 1:12 – Then said the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</strong> God will do what he said. He&rsquo;s waiting on faith-filled saints to speak the word into our circumstances to bring about change. <br>
  <br>
      The power of God&rsquo;s word is realized when we realize that there is power in what we say. Death and life is in the power of the tongue. Don&rsquo;t let anything to convince you to say something contrary to the word of God. <br>
      <br>
      We must be in agreement with the word of God, which transcends now or six months from now, but it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere. Be not weary – don&rsquo;t give up on God, if it hasn&rsquo;t happened never let the flesh to make you say things that are contrary. <br>
      <br>
      Whatsoever you say – we have everything that pertains to life and Godliness but if you don&rsquo;t believe it, you won&rsquo;t receive it. If you don&rsquo;t ask in faith – you won&rsquo;t receive it – <strong>Hebrews 11:6 - But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him</strong>. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Mark 11:22 – And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</strong> Anyone who has faith in God can speak to the mountain and believe that it shall come to pass. No matter the time frame. Don&rsquo;t allow time to change your confession. Just because it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t happen.<br>
  <br>
      Remember Caleb – God kept him for 40 years to bring him what he promised. It will happen – you must watch what you say.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 5:14 – For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.</strong> I&rsquo;m not just an old sinner. I have been seated and seeded in heavenly places in Christ. <br>
  <br>
      Spiritual growth is needed – we can&rsquo;t pray to God one day then speak against what we prayed the next day.<br>
      <br>
      When I pray, I believe that I have it. I don&rsquo;t wait until I see it, that&rsquo;s not faith. Find out what the word says about the things you desire, and then pray for what you desire. <br>
      Don&rsquo;t go to God with the problem; go to God with the answer. God&rsquo;s word is the final authority. <strong>Psalm 34:1 – I will bless the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</strong> God gave us a choice to receive the righteousness in Christ. What God says must be our main focus.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Matthew 6:30-31 – </strong><strong>30&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? </strong><strong>31&nbsp;</strong><strong>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</strong><br>
      Remain in what God has said. Don&rsquo;t put the thought into motion. When the thought comes, cast it down. Don&rsquo;t say it. <br>
      <br>
      Remember the mouth sets the stage for our lives.<br>
      <br>
      Take God&rsquo;s word and act on it. So whatever you&rsquo;re dealing with, take God&rsquo;s word and act on it. <br>
      <br>
      Act on what God says. <br>
      <br>
      When we go thru things we shouldn&rsquo;t get caught up in fear because we know who&rsquo;s in control.<br>
      <br>
      Only with your eyes will you see it but it won&rsquo;t come near you. Isaiah 40 – Repetitiously speak what the word of God says and be aware of those who came in to your environment with doubt. <br>
      <br>
      In our daily lives there will be people who come to us that don&rsquo;t believe the word of God. <br>
      People will respond to fear but won&rsquo;t respond to the word of God. If you can believe – All things are possible. <br>
      <br>
      The word of God is food.<strong> Isaiah 40:31 – But they that wait upon the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</strong> All of this is incumbent upon waiting. We need patience in order to live a victorious life. I don&rsquo;t know where he will do it, but I know that he will.<br>
      <br>
      Saying something for so long builds up a stronghold in our lives. If I&rsquo;m speaking positive it builds up positivity in my life. <br>
      <br>
      There are some things in our lives that we have talked ourselves out of. There is correlation to faith and words. God&rsquo;s word is the answer. While you&rsquo;re waiting, don&rsquo;t be anxious.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:6 – Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong><br>
  <br>
      Make your prayer words and your daily words, words of faith – words that that are in agreement with God&rsquo;s words.<br>
      <br>
      When we pray – we pray based on the word of God. <br>
      <br>
      We&rsquo;re in Christ. We have divine promises and answers to prayer. <strong>Psalm 91:14-15 – </strong><strong>14&nbsp;</strong><strong>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>15&nbsp;</strong><strong>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</strong><strong></strong><br>
      <br>
      Since he set his love upon me – I will deliver him. God didn&rsquo;t say you would be without trouble. But he will be with you while you&rsquo;re in your in trouble – deliver you from trouble and honor him. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 33:3 – Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.</strong> Call upon me and I will answer you and show you things you&rsquo;ve never seen before. <br>
  <br>
      You&rsquo;re in prayer and God is saying, &ldquo;I got you&rdquo;. When the wicked come upon you, they will stumble and fall – I&rsquo;m not worried about them. We are secure – if we walk in the word. <br>
      Don&rsquo;t be concerned. Every morning get up happy. Don&rsquo;t get up wondering if you will be blessed. You are blessed because you&rsquo;re awake.<br>
      <br>
      True prayers is heard, but God doesn&rsquo;t hear sinners. <strong>Psalm 4:3 – But know that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;will hear when I call unto him.<br>
      </strong><br>
      Repent and have a right relationship with God in order to have access to the things of God.<br>
      The just shall live by faith. Those who are declared righteous shall live by faith. <br>
      <br>
      When you look at the Old Testament and the New Testament look at what they endured. <br>
      Paul was beaten. Peter, who denied Christ, righted himself and became anointed. <br>
      <br>
      The same anointing that rested on them rest upon us.<br>
      <br>
    We have a covenant with God. </p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Mastering the Storms in Life</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Luke 10:19, 1 John 1:14, Psalm 1:12, Philippians 4:12, Deuteronomy 5:33,  Matthew 28:18, Luke 8:22, Hebrews 13:6, Romans 8:37, Psalm 118:6-7, Psalm 56:3-4, 2 Corinthians 4:8-9, 2 Corinthians 1:20, Proverbs 18:21, John 6:63, Isaiah 55:11, Joshua 1:8, Mark 16:17-18, Hebrews 11:6, Luke 10:19, 1 John 1:14, Psalm 1:12, Philippians 4:12, Deuteronomy 5:33, Matthew 28:18, Luke 8:22, Hebrews 13:6, Romans 8:37, Psalm 118:6-7, Psalm 56:3-4, 2 Corinthians 4:8-9, 2 Corinthians 1:20, Proverbs 18:21, John 6:63, Isaiah 55:11, Joshua 1:8, Mark 16:17-18, Hebrews 11:6 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Every time you face a circumstance you have to say the word of God. Even if you&rsquo;re just saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working for my good.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t look at the things that are seen. The things that are seen are temporary. When you walk by faith, you begin to manifest those things that speak to our victory.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t say we won&rsquo;t be anxious or we won&rsquo;t have problems. There will be some times where we will be afraid. <strong>Luke 8:22 – Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. </strong> This is God&rsquo;s word, if he said it, it&rsquo;s going to come to pass. The disciples didn&rsquo;t have the God-kind of faith in their lives. If the disciples acted in faith, they wouldn&rsquo;t have woken Christ. </p>
    <p>The word of God will not pass away we must speak faith-filled words. <strong>Matthew 28:18 –  </strong><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</strong> You have power. We need faith to act on the power. Every born-again Christian has the spirit within. </p>
    <p><strong>Luke 10:19 – Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. </strong>You have power over the enemy. The enemy doesn&rsquo;t have power he has methods of deception. </p>
    <p>We as the people of God has power over the enemy. We are made in the image of Christ. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 1:14 – And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</strong> As he is so are we. We have authority in this world. We have to walk in God&rsquo;s way. My actions, character and relationship must line up with the word of God. </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 1:12 –  But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. </strong>How we are to live. Put the word of God in your mouth and speak faith-filled words. I&rsquo;m saying what God said.</p>
    <p>Sometimes what God says can go against all reasoning. It may be a fact that you have nothing to eat in the refrigerator but God&rsquo;s truth. <strong>Philippians 4:12 – </strong><strong>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. </strong>The word of God is truth. God will give me methods to obtain the things to supply our needs. </p>
    <p>All things work together for our good. God gives us wisdom to do what&rsquo;s necessary to make the word of God come alive in your life. <strong>Deuteronomy 5:33 – </strong><strong>Ye shall walk in all the ways which the </strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. </strong> It&rsquo;s the will of God that you be successful in all that you encounter.</p>
    <p>Trials happen for a reason. If nothing comes in our life there is a problem. You must need the wisdom and understanding to differentiate the call of God on your life from demonic attacks and human error.  </p>
    <p>Sometimes we go through things for the sake of the gospel. When we face adversity, we need to have assurance. <strong>Hebrews 13:6 –  </strong><strong>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. </strong>Boldly say it even while you deal with your situation. </p>
    <p>As long as we walk by faith and action, all of the resources of heaven and earth are at your disposal.</p>
    <p>Failure can&rsquo;t happen in your life without your permission. <strong>Romans 8:37 – </strong><strong>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. </strong>We are more than conquerors in every circumstance or situation. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow the way that you feel currently and the information that you receive to remove you from the word of God.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 118:6-7 – The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 7&nbsp;The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</strong><br>
       I don&rsquo;t allow fear to manifest in my life. I won&rsquo;t be afraid even if the news isn&rsquo;t good news, I won&rsquo;t fear.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 56:3-4 –  3&nbsp;What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 4&nbsp;In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</strong><br>
      I will trust in thee. There are times where we may be fearful, but we have the promise of God which proves that we aren&rsquo;t defeated. <strong>2 Corinthians 1:20 - </strong><strong>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</strong></p>
    <p>2 Corinthians 4:8-9 – Never respond to something in your life as if God is somewhere else, because you&rsquo;re not forsaken.</p>
    <p>Never speak the language of unbelief:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I can&rsquo;t</li>
      <li>I don&rsquo;t have</li>
      <li>I can&rsquo;t have</li>
      <li>God won&rsquo;t do this</li>
      <li>I&rsquo;m not able to</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We can do ALL things through Christ!</p>
    <p>We must watch our speech. What am I saying about my situation? <strong>Proverbs 18:21 –  </strong><strong>&nbsp;Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. </strong>Death and life are in the power of the tongue.</p>
    <p>Nothing happens in our life until we use our faith.</p>
    <p>Faith gives me access to what I need. You must deal with the un-supervised areas of your life.</p>
    <p>What do you tolerate that you  shouldn&rsquo;t? What you tolerate you can&rsquo;t change.</p>
    <p>What you tolerate speaks volumes about who you are and what you believe.</p>
    <p>Time doesn&rsquo;t decide miracles, faith does.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s the will of God that we are successful in all that we encounter. </p>
    <p><strong>John 6:63 – It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. </strong> Give voice to the word of God.</p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah 55:11 – So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. </strong>Be convinced of the victory of God&rsquo;s word. God&rsquo;s word will not return to him empty. It will occur. </p>
    <p>When you meditate on the word and apply it to your situation. </p>
    <p>Every situation in our life you can find the answer in the word of God. Speak the word of God.</p>
    <p><strong>Joshua 1:8 – This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>Meditate on the word. The victory is constantly being in the word and saying what God says about the word. Meditate on the word – then get a vision. Act on the vision. </p>
    <p>Vision without action is just wasting time. We have the promises of God. </p>
    <p>But you must challenge your ability. </p>
    <p>Just saying, I can do all things through Christ, isn&rsquo;t enough. You must do something. </p>
    <p>Peter walked on water, because he believed, then he moved. He was willing to get out of the boat. </p>
    <p>They weren&rsquo;t on a pond, they were on a lake, but he had faith.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow the size of the situation to intimidate you – believe in God. </p>
    <p>Peter got out of the boat.</p>
    <p>There are times in our lives that you may have to do something foolish or crazy to satisfy your belief in God. </p>
    <p>There are times when you have to get out of the boat. </p>
    <p>Challenge your ability – there is so much more that we are capable of. </p>
    <p>Never live your life on past experiences or others past experiences. </p>
    <p>There is so much more. </p>
    <p><strong>Mark 16:17-18 – And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</strong><br>
      <strong>18&nbsp;</strong><strong>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</strong><br>
      Say what God has already said about you. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 11:6 – But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </strong> We have the prescription for living an abundant life. </p>
    <p>Put God first. </p>
    <p>The goal should be to grow in faith.</p>
    <p>I want a closer walk with God.</p>
    <p>See the benefit in trials and joy. Our faith is strengthened through tests and trials. </p>
    <p>Remember what he did in the past. If he did it before, he will do it again. </p>
    <p>Have the kind of relationship with God where we know our prayers have been answered. </p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  May 3, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Growing in the Spirit – Grow or Die</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Psalm 141:3, Proverbs 10:11, Matthew 6:33, Proverbs 10:23, 1 John 2:15, Romans 13:14, 2 Peter 1:5, Galatians 5:22 – 23, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Thessalonians 1:3, 1 Peter 4:17, Ephesians 4:14 – 15, Ephesians 3:17 – 19, John 15:4, Leviticus 27:8<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Grow in grace and in the knowledge. Sanctify yourselves and be Holy. We are commanded to grow in our faith, understanding, commitment and holiness. <strong>Leviticus 27:8 - </strong><strong>But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>John 15:4 - Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</strong> – Abide in me and I in you. Don&rsquo;t be deceived into believing that all it takes to get to heaven is to show up for service.</p>
    <p>We need to repent and accept Christ as our Lord. We must be born again and now we must grow in faith. </p>
    <p>God commands us to grow in the spirit. <strong>Ephesians 3:17 – 19 –</strong> <strong>17&nbsp;</strong><strong>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</strong><br>
      <strong>18&nbsp;</strong><strong>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; </strong><strong>19&nbsp;</strong><strong>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</strong></p>
    <p>We must first be rooted and grounded in love. Faith worketh by love. Being like Christ is the goal for spiritual growth. <strong>Ephesians 4:14 – 15 - </strong><strong>14&nbsp;</strong><strong>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; </strong><strong>15&nbsp;</strong><strong>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ</strong> shows us how to be like Christ. <strong></strong><br>
      <br>
      Everything you hear is not the truth. Every preacher, preaching isn&rsquo;t teaching the truth. The truth sets you free – not a fell good message.</p>
    <p>We have to speak the truth in love. Not beating anyone over the head with the gospel. Speak the truth in love. Don&rsquo;t witness to people by condemning them. Aspects of spiritual growth – grow in grace in the knowledge of Christ. Study to show yourself approved. The grace will enable us to understand the knowledge. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 4:17 – &nbsp;For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? </strong>If judgment begins with us, what of those who do not obey. Revelations 21:8 – the second death. The soul that sinneth shall die – we must grow or die.</p>
    <p>Spiritual growth, we mist preach the truth – regardless if others like it or not. In order to grow we must grow in faith and in love.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Thessalonians 1:3 – We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; </strong>Your faith, growing exceedingly. We should love each other more and more each day. We can disagree but we must disagree in love.</p>
    <p>Whenever you listen to a preacher, analyze the word that you receive. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Peter 1:3 – According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. </strong>God supplies the resources for spiritual growth. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 5:22 – 23 - </strong><strong>22&nbsp;</strong><strong>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, </strong><strong>23&nbsp;</strong><strong>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. </strong>Don&rsquo;t ask for peace. Get the knowledge then you receive the peace through the knowledge.<strong></strong></p>
    <p>We have to make every effort to grow. <strong>2 Peter 1:5 - And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge. Knowledge</strong>, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness. When Christ saved us, we were washed. Old sins have passed away. You were purged from those sins. Don&rsquo;t let the enemy remind you. <br>
      <br>
      Until our minds are renewed we don&rsquo;t know what we already have. We need to transform our minds. </p>
    <p>In order to grow you must deny yourself. It&rsquo;s not about us. You must die to self and study the word. </p>
    <p>You want to grow have a little talk with Jesus.</p>
    <p>Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit is writing, but thr flresh is weak. We need to walk in the spirit. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 13:14 – But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</strong> Make no provisions for the flesh. The flesh is always lusting.</p>
    <p>Come out from among them. If there are people who have a hold on you that causes. You to sin – stay away from them until you are strong.</p>
    <p>When we grown – there has to be evidence. <strong>1 John 2:15 – 17 – </strong><strong>15&nbsp;</strong><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. </strong><strong>16&nbsp;</strong><strong>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. </strong><strong>17&nbsp;</strong><strong>And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</strong> Our minds have to be transformed. <strong></strong></p>
    <p>Seek those things that are above where Christ. Sits. Constantly seek Christ – don&rsquo;t let material things distract you. He gives you what you need.</p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 6:33 – But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</strong> Seek first the kingdom of God. </p>
    <p>Change your conversation – some of the things that you say, you shouldn&rsquo;t be saying. <strong>Proverbs 10:23 - &nbsp;It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Proverbs 10:11 - The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Be still – you don&rsquo;t have to prove anything.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 141:3 – Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</strong> Set a watch over my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.  I don&rsquo;t need to eat that, drink that, respond to that or have the last word. </p>
    <p>Grave yards are filled with people who had the last word. There are marriages that would be still intact if they didn&rsquo;t have the last word. </p>

    <strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  May 10, 2015
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> I Remember Mama</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 2 Timothy 1:5-6, Proverbs 22:6, Proverbs 1, 2 Timothy 1:6    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:5-6 - </strong><strong>5&nbsp;</strong><strong>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. </strong><strong>6&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</strong></p>
    <p>God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind. In today&rsquo;s society being a mother is an awesome task. It can be difficult when God is removed from public places. </p>
    <p>Anything goes in this society – So your kids have little chance of having Christian values, unless you teach them. </p>
    <p>Some churches aren&rsquo;t preaching the gospel because they don&rsquo;t want to offend anyone. Watered down version of preaching. </p>
    <p>Whether you like it or not the gospel is the gospel. Pastor has been instructed in season and out to preach the gospel. </p>
    <p><strong>Proverbs 22:6 – Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</strong> It is our responsibility to teach the kids about the gospel. The word of God is your guide for living.</p>
    <p>Proverbs 1 – the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but some folks don&rsquo;t want to hear what God says. </p>
    <p>In this society kids know exactly what to do, if they are disciplined. They simply call 911. If you train them up properly they wont have to dial 911. If they know that you are the parent and they respect you they will know better.</p>
    <p>Reverence of the Lord is required. Forsake not the law of thy mother. </p>
    <p>The ministry of the gospel is no place for timid souls or lack of enthusiasm. </p>
    <p>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. </p>
    <p>Its essential for any kind of understanding. Stir up the gift of God. <strong>2 Timothy 1:6 - Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the</strong> <strong>gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</strong></p>
    <p>Godly mothers have all the resources needed. </p>
    <p>Wisdom is the principle thing but you must also get understanding. In the word of God is instruction for marriage, family, jobs and children. </p>
    <p>Godly mothers have the responsibility to know how to parent.  <strong>Proverbs 1:8 - My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</strong></p>
    <p>Timothy remembered the character of the grandmother and mother. It didn&rsquo;t come through hereditary but by prayer. They know how to run the household. A child left to himself, brings shame to his mother.</p>
    <p>Children have to watch who they hang with. They have so miuch against them. It takes mom and grandmother help them.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s time for mothers and fathers to stand up and say enough is enough. </p>
    <p>The greatest thing is love – so we love.</p>
    <p>We need Godly women to carry on the work of God. <br>
      <br>
      Who will stand on the word of God?</p>
    <p>Teach your children!</p></div>

    <strong>    Date:</strong> May 13, 2015
    <p><strong>Scriptures: </strong>John 1:1, Proverbs 16:12, Jeremiah 32:17, Hebrews 13:5, Ephesians 3:6, Psalm 118:6-7, Psalm 107:20, Philippians 4:13, Psalm 73:26, 1 Kings 8:56, Jeremiah 1:12, Jeremiah 17:7-8, 2 Corinthians 10:5, 2 Corinthians 4:15, Psalm 34:10, John 10:10, Proverbs 12:25</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic: </strong>The Formula for Overcoming Obstacles</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>We are victorious even before the problem arises. In Christ you are always more than conquerors, because you are always in Christ. </p>
    <p>When God said lets go to the other side, it was pre-determined in advance that they would safely make it to the other side.</p>
    <p>Everything that has, will or have happened, God already knows. He knows our end from our beginning. We must take the word of God to everything in life. Jeremiah 32:17 – Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee. There is nothing too hard for God. We can see how this applies to us. There is nothing too hard for God.</p>
    <p>There is a requirement for us to approach things from a Godly perspective. Proverbs 16:12 – God made everything for himself. John 1:1 – In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by God. That’s the God we serve.<br>
      We need a disciplined mind. When we look at the circumstance, it distracts us from believing in God’s word. The Bible tells us to look at what is not seen.</p>
    <p>This tells us that we can see things that are not seen. What’s not seen is subject to change.<br>
      We need to have confidence in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit abides in us. The power that is in us is the same power that raised Jesus from the dead.</p>
    <p>None of our situations are bigger or more powerful than what’s in us.</p>
    <p>Some things we see are fact, but not the truth.</p>
    <p>I can have $0 in my bank account and not be broke. When this happens I don’t panic and say what doesn’t line up with the word of God, nor do I do something that God wouldn’t be pleased with in order to get stuff.</p>
    <p>We need assistance – there are words that will cause you to not walk in faith.</p>
    <p>·         Doubt<br>
      ·         Disbelief<br>
      ·         Stress<br>
      ·         Depression</p>
    <p>You can’t walk by faith and worry. We have to be mindful, during the storm so we don’t forget what Jesus said.</p>
    <p>Hebrews 13:5 – Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. Apply the word continually to your situation. This verse eliminates lust and greed. I’m content with what I have.</p>
    <p>Don’t say that God is not here. Boldly say the Lord is my helper. When you get to the point where the situation intensifies and from all outward appearances, doesn’t look good, I can boldly say that the Lord is my helper.</p>
    <p>Fear counteracts faith. Ephesians 3:6 – That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. The enemy has methods not power. He uses methods to plant thoughts in your mind and move you away from the truth and from your place in God.</p>
    <p>Discipline your thoughts to only receive what lines up with God. Some information you can’t allow yourself to receive from well-meaning people.</p>
    <p>Don’t let them take what’s in your spirit. They’re looking at what’s seen. They can see what’s not seen. If you agree with them, you take what they say over the word of God.</p>
    <p>Psalm 118:6-7 – 6 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 7 The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</p>
    <p>The Lord is on my side, I will not fear. Whatever it is and you receive a report it can be factual, but not the whole truth. I’m not putting my confidence in man, over what God says.</p>
    <p>All problems are already solved.</p>
    <p>Psalm 107:20 – He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. He sent his word in the beginning. He healed and delivered them by his word. When you verbalize, Philippians 4:13 – I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. There is nothing through Christ that I can’t do. If I can do all things through Christ, our strength comes from God.<br>
      Psalm 73:26 – My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. We have the assurance in times of trouble that God is the strength of our heart. When you’re dealing with something, never let the problem prophesize to you.</p>
    <p>It will try to talk you out of your position in faith. It’s trying to get you to the place of saying, “I can’t”. No one will help me. Stop blaming others for your situation/circumstances.</p>
    <p>If there is lack it’s a lack of faith. I need a revelation to walk in truth.</p>
    <p>That’s why the bible is so important.</p>
    <p>·         We need a role-model</p>
    <p>·         We need to see the truth lived out</p>
    <p>·         We need a regiment of faith.</p>
    <p>How you think determines your beliefs. When we get anxious, ask God to increase our faith, because all problems have been solved.</p>
    <p>Be assured in the promises of God. You need that kind of assurance.</p>
    <p>1 Kings 8:56 – Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. When you get the word, meditate on it, until it becomes a fabric of your being and you speak faith-filled words to your situation. Everything God said will come to pass.<br>
      Jeremiah 1:12 – Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it. We have the assurance in adversity. Whatever God said, he will bring to pass.</p>
    <p>Be God-centered. Don’t allow your mind to run after craziness, be God-centered. What did the Lord say?</p>
    <p>Block out negativity and dis-jointed thinking. Information constantly being fed to your spirit. Discipline yourself to only hear the word of God.</p>
    <p>Jeremiah 17:7-8 – 7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. 8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</p>
    <p>You will always have more than enough. You will always prosper.</p>
    <p>Don’t go around saying what you don’t have. Be careful what you say. 2 Corinthians 10:5 – Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. Cast down those contrary thoughts. What I see and hear, cast it down. No matter how intense the situation gets, never speak doubt.</p>
    <p>Never get to a place of “Oh what will I do?” Then you become like the disciples in the boat.<br>
      Guard your tongue.</p>
    <p>He’s already told us what to do.</p>
    <p>You have the victory, now. Be led by the spirit. When you accept Christ as your Lord and savior you are sealed and saved.</p>
    <p>Be God-centered.</p>
    <p>2 Corinthians 4:15 – For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. The unmerited favor from God for victorious living.</p>
    <p>Do you know what highly favored really means? You don’t deserve it, but he loves us so much.<br>
      We also have spiritual abundance, Psalm 34:10 - The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. We shall not want any good thing. </p>
    <p>John 10:10 – The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
    <p>You are victorious in circumstances if you walk by faith. Go back and look at what God did in the past.</p>
    <p>Have confidence in him. He is not a man that he will lie.</p>
    <p>We need a disciplined lifestyle. Don’t seek God only when you’re in a crisis. Early will I seek thee.<br>
      God knew about the trouble before it occurred. He gives us free will. Sometimes we get ourselves into situations, but he’s there for us.</p>
    <p>Don’t be afraid to fail. That’s what grace is all about.</p>
    <p>You grow from failure. Guard against the flesh.</p>
    <p>Since failure is common, change the way you respond to it.</p>
    <p>It’s just a stepping stone.</p>
    <p>Have confidence in what God has done and have confidence in the word of God. Isaiah 55:10 – the rain that comes from heaven comes with a purpose.</p>
    <p>So does God’s word. It comes to do what God has already ordained.</p>
    <p>Never focus on those things or emotions that lead you from God’s word.</p>
    <p>Stress, anxiety, fear and doubt. Whatever you say, you will have. That’s the power of speech. You must discipline your mind.</p>
    <p>Proverbs 12:25 – Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. We must trust God without full understanding. God doesn't need to explain everything to you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Faith acts like it is so, when it is not so, so it will be so.</p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Salvation Question</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 5:22, Romans 5:12, Romans 6:22, 1 Timothy 5:6, Titus 3:5, John 3:16, 1 Corinthians 6:19, Isaiah 59:1-2 , Romans 10:17, Romans 10:14, Jeremiah 3:15, Hebrews 4:1-7, Ephesians 1:3, Philippians 4:13, 1 John 3:14, 1 John 4:7-8, Galatians 5, Galatians 3:1 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong> John 5:22 – For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</strong> The subject matter covers one of the most important decisions in your life. Yielding your life to Christ. Why do we need to be saved?</p>
    <p>When Adam sinned – man was separated by sin. We were born in sin and shaped by iniquity. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:12 - Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Romans 6:22</strong> <strong>– But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</strong> This vertells the price of sin. Everyone who isn&rsquo;t born again is a walking corpse. Unless Christ is savior and Lord in your life, you are dead.</p>
    <p>Some have the form of godliness but live in pleasure. <strong>1 Timothy 5:6 – </strong><strong>But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</strong> Those who live in pleasure area already dead. You don&rsquo;t have to do something to be saved. Doing things wont save you. Some believe that you have to work to be saved. </p>
    <p>Christ died for all of us. <strong>Titus 3:5</strong> <strong>– Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>John 3:16</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong> Every religion that takes God and rejects Jesus is lost. You can&rsquo;t be saved any other way.</p>
    <p>Every Christian was once dead in sin.</p>
    <p>New life in Christ brings new priorities. <strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> – You were bought with a price. Christ sacrificed his life on the cross. </p>
    <p>Sin cuts humanity off from God. <strong>Isaiah 59:1-2</strong> <strong>- </strong><strong>Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</strong><br>
      <strong>2&nbsp;</strong><strong>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</strong> Your iniquities have separated you. </p>
    <p>If there is iniquity in your heart the Lord will not hear you. </p>
    <p>If you find your prayers aren&rsquo;t being answered, don&rsquo;t look at God, look at yourself.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s up to you to take the first step to squash issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 10:17 - So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Romans 10:14 - How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>You must hear the raiment word because that is  how faith comes. <strong>Jeremiah 3:15</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</strong></p>
    <p>We must hear and believe – that&rsquo;s what faith is. <strong>Hebrews 4:1-7</strong> <strong>- </strong><strong>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</strong><br>
      <strong>2&nbsp;</strong><strong>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</strong><br>
      <strong>3&nbsp;</strong><strong>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</strong><br>
      <strong>4&nbsp;</strong><strong>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</strong><br>
      <strong>5&nbsp;</strong><strong>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</strong><br>
      <strong>6&nbsp;</strong><strong>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</strong><br>
      <strong>7&nbsp;</strong><strong>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. </strong>He turns everyone from their sin. Evidence of the salvation is everlasting life.  </p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.</strong> Everything that we need is in Christ. All it takes is faith. Your mouth is a resource and a weapon.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t cancel out yourself by saying I can&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t or I don&rsquo;t. Cast those thoughts down. Keep saying <strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> <strong>- </strong><strong>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong> Say it until what&rsquo;s on the inside shows on the outside. Your answers to every circumstance is in the Bible. Call on the name of the Lord so you can be saved from your enemies. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:14</strong> <strong>– We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:7-8</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. </strong><strong>8&nbsp;</strong><strong>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</strong> He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love.<strong></strong></p>
    <p>The enemy will try to tempt you with old things. Don&rsquo;t let him – there is always a way out.</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 5</strong> – <strong>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</strong></p>
    <p>Stand fast in the liberty. Don&rsquo;t tie yourself up with that stuff. The adversary uses the phone to create a riff in the church. Some things don&rsquo;t need to be shared or forwarded. </p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 3:1</strong> <strong>– O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</strong> Seek those things that are seated above where Christ sits. Set your affections on things above. </p>
    <p>Discipline your mind so it doesn&rsquo;t get caught up in the world. <br>
      <br>
      We belong to God, we must carry that image of Christ. </p>

    <strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  May 24, 2015
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Pentecost Sunday Message</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong>  1 Corinthians 15:20, 1 Corinthians 15:13, Ezekiel 36:37, John 3:16, Psalm 139, Zacharia 4:6, Romans 10:2-3, 1 Timothy 3, Mathew 2:37, Ephesians 2:12, Ephesians 5, Galatians 5:16 – 5:17, Jeremiah 17:5, 1 Corinthians 2:9, 1 John 4:1, 1 Corinthians 6:19 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pentecost is 7 weeks after the resurrection of Christ. <strong>1 Corinthians 15:20</strong> – </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:13</strong> – When Christ returns those who died in Christ will be resurrected. </p>
    <p><strong>Ezekiel 36:37</strong> – When the Holy Spirit abides in you and reveals truth to you – you can&rsquo;t do what you want to do. You must follow the spirit. </p>
    <p>The Holy Ghost is co-equal with Jesus. God is the father, God is the son and God is the holy spirit. </p>
    <p><strong>John 3:16</strong> – I give you a comforter – he may abide with you forever. You have a comforter to keep you in perfect peace. There is no need to worry.</p>
    <p>He knows all things. We see the characteristic of the spirit. He&rsquo;s omnipresent. <strong>Psalm 139</strong> – He has infinite power. <strong>Zacharia 4:6</strong> – There is nothing we do on our own. It&rsquo;s only then that I can do all things through Christ. <br>
      <br>
      We are Christ&rsquo;s disciples. We must take the spirit into the world and witness. You can&rsquo;t be a witness without the power of God. </p>
    <p>The Spirit doesn&rsquo;t stay in here – it goes out into the world. </p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to come into Church to be at the alter Christians are baptized in the spirit. <br>
      John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized by the Holy Spirit. </p>
    <p>They waited ten days in the upper room. There were no questions about who&rsquo;s in charge or what&rsquo;s taking so long. There are problems in the church and Paul addressed them in <strong>Romans 10:2-3</strong>. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Timothy 3</strong> – When you come into church remember that we&rsquo;re spirit lead not bulletin guided. </p>
    <p>As long as the word is being preached nothing else matters.<br>
      <br>
      There are those who have their own way of doing things and are blinded by the truth.</p>
    <p>If you want to see the church grow – submit to Christ. The Lord will grow the church.</p>
    <p>All you have to do is have faith in God and be obedient to his word. </p>
    <p><strong>Mathew 2:37</strong> – Don&rsquo;t get caught up in the deeds. Empty worship – outwardly beautiful<br>
      <br>
      On the day of Pentecost, they were all in one place on one accord and their thoughts were unified. When you ask God for something, expect to receive it. </p>
    <p>You can identify those without the Holy Ghost. They&rsquo;re speaking the same language.</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 2:12</strong> – The spirit man came alive. Every unsaved person is subject to the adversary.  You don&rsquo;t have to speak in tongues different from your own. No matter the nationality the love Christ connects us. </p>
    <p>Baptism takes only once, filling is an ongoing process. You&rsquo;re not always filled. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ephesians 5</strong>: - When I&rsquo;m filled by the spirit, I&rsquo;m lead by the spirit. When the spirit is in control of us, we say kind words to each other. <br>
      <br>
      Spiritual people don&rsquo;t lie, cheat and backbite. The spirit is opposed to natural desire. <strong>Galatians 5:16 – 5:17</strong> – you can&rsquo;t do the things that you want to do because the spirit is lusting with the flesh. <br>
  <br>
      A negative thought produces strongholds in your mind. Get rid of those thoughts. If you meditate on those thoughts they take root. </p>
    <p>Being led by the flesh opens you up to the curse. <strong>Jeremiah 17:5</strong> – We must trust in the Lord and lean not to our own understanding. The Holy Spirit reveals God&rsquo;s purpose for us. </p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:9</strong> – You must constantly discipline yourself to be led by God. When I&rsquo;m lead by the spirit, I am able to discern the truth. When I&rsquo;m not led by the spirit I won&rsquo;t be able to distinguish the spirit of God from the spirit of the adversary.</p>
    <p>Everything that is preached is not truth. Unless you&rsquo;re spirit lead and can discern the truth you take anything as the gospel. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> – Don&rsquo;t believe every spirit – no matter how they come. The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead abides in us. God didn&rsquo;t give the disciples anything that he didn&rsquo;t give the church.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> – Your body is a temple. Stop acting like you&rsquo;re your own. You were bought with a price. </p>
    <p>Glorify God. <br>
      We have to start living right.</p>
    <p>When the Holy Spirit and your spirit are in agreement with each other you have peace. The anointing allows you to stand. There is a difference in singing and singing under the anointing of Christ. You may have a beautiful voice but without the anointing there is no ministry. </p>
    <p>Every born again believer is anointed but the anointing must be manifested. </p></div>

    <strong>Bible Study Date:</strong>  May 20, 2015
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Assurance in Faith, Hope in Adversity</p>
    <p><strong>Foundational Scripture:  </strong>Luke 8:22</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Matthew 6:33, Psalm 20:7, Habakkuk 3:17, Romans 15:4, 1 Timothy 6:20 – 21, Job 1:6, Psalm 138:7, Hebrews 10:35 – 36, Isaiah 40:28, Romans 8:35, 1 John 1:6 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We must have the assurance that what God promised will come to pass. Don&rsquo;t rationalize it, don&rsquo;t figure it out, have faith.</p>
    <p>If you have the God-kind of faith, you will do greater things.</p>
    <p>Every morning get up with that kind of mindset. Not only have the mindset but even in your prayer time, keep the mindset that there is nothing that God can&rsquo;t do.</p>
    <p>We need the God-kind of faith. Today, I will have no distractions or suffer defeat.</p>
    <p>Never let your circumstances prophesize to you. Your situations are always saying something to you, but you need discipline not to agree with the situation.</p>
    <p>You are committed to what you confess. Profess your position in Christ. Ephesians 1</p>
    <p>Matthew 6:33 – Seek the kingdom first. We must make sure that we&rsquo;re closer to God. The closer you move to God, the smaller everything else appears. </p>
    <p>We must have confidence in God&rsquo;s purpose, presence and protection. </p>
    <p>When I have confidence in his presence it makes me bold.</p>
    <p>Psalm 20:7 – Remember the name of God. I don&rsquo;t follow after those who are trusting in other things.</p>
    <p>No matter the relationships, if they don&rsquo;t trust in the word of God, I can&rsquo;t be in agreement with them. I can&rsquo;t be in agreement with them and be in agreement with God. </p>
    <p>The disciples were unified in their unbelief. There will be times where you&rsquo;ll be in a storm and you won&rsquo;t receive confidence or encouragement from anyone, but you must trust in God. </p>
    <p>While you trust in God, be careful of the words you receive. Unless they&rsquo;re quoting the word of God, it counteracts our faith.</p>
    <p>We must have confidence in God&rsquo;s presence and his purpose. </p>
    <p>Confidence in God enables believers to endure difficulty.  Believers don&rsquo;t believe that they won&rsquo;t have to ensure anything many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God delivers.</p>
    <p>There are times in our lives when you can encourage yourself by remembering what God did in the past.</p>
    <p>David slayed Goliath and recalled the lion and bear that God allowed him to kill. </p>
    <p>Habakkuk 3:17 – The example that God gives is an example of how the farmers lost everything but they rejoiced in the Lord.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m going to rejoice even though I&rsquo;m facing difficulties. Never allow circumstances to rob you of your destiny.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re going to have to deal with doubt. In dealing with doubt you gain assurance though God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p>Knowing the word of God is key. You must know the word of God in order to deal. Remember God&rsquo;s past goodness and reflect on the power of God.</p>
    <p>Bear ye one another burdens. When one of us is down we are supposed to be in prayer for someone – knowing that some day I may need it. We deal with doubt and gain assurance from God&rsquo;s word. </p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s why studying the scripture is important. Romans 15:4 – everything in the book was written for our learning and admonition. It was written for us.</p>
    <p>In dealing with doubt avoid idle speculation. Avoid idle talk. </p>
    <p>1 Timothy 6:20 – 21 – Avoid profane and vain babbling. Things people say that is not spiritual is profane babbling.</p>
    <p>Some things that people say have been said so many times that some take it as the word of God.</p>
    <p>Avoid foolish questions. When we&rsquo;re dealing with situations and circumstances one of the key is to say focused on what the word of God says. </p>
    <p>Our success is linked to our doing something. I must continually apply the word of God to the situation.  Jesus spoke to the wind – the wind was the cause of the rough seas.</p>
    <p>You need a relationship with God to appropriate the grace of God. </p>
    <p>If I don&rsquo;t have a relationship with God I can&rsquo;t submit my requests to him.</p>
    <p>Job 1:6 – God doesn&rsquo;t have to talk to us about our storms. God knew that Job would stand the test.</p>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re going through – don&rsquo;t get weary in the storm because God knows what he placed in you. He knows you won&rsquo;t fail.</p>
    <p>There may be some things that you&rsquo;re dealing with but don&rsquo;t blame the devil for what happens in your life. </p>
    <p>If you have the grace to obey God, you will be successful. </p>
    <p>We are persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed – I&rsquo;m not forsaken. I have to endure some things, but I keep looking for the time when it&rsquo;s over. </p>
    <p>I verbalize it then get an image of an overcomer. My mouth is a weapon. </p>
    <p>Meditate on the word, so before you get to a circumstance you have already been meditating on the word of God.</p>
    <p>When you do this, the Holy Spirit will agree with your spirit so that the things you speak will happen.</p>
    <p>The word of God is a strong tower. It&rsquo;s his will to teach us by example. Read, meditate, verbalize and then internalize the word.</p>
    <p>When we praise God, we&rsquo;re able to endure the pain.</p>
    <p>Psalm 138:7 – When is his hand saving me? In the midst of trouble I have the assurance that he saves me. </p>
    <p>Hebrews 10:35 – 36 – We need patience and the will of God must be paramount in our lives. I will continue to do the will of God. Trust in God. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t allow doubt or idle speculation to remain in your mind.</p>
    <p>Isaiah 40:28 – We don&rsquo;t try to use our finite minds and limited understanding to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
    <p>You must remain focused on the word of God.</p>
    <p>We will all get to the point where no matter what we&rsquo;re dealing with we want to handle it, but we must wait on the Lord.</p>
    <p>There is a season where you&rsquo;re in a trial and a season where you come out of it.</p>
    <p>Having that understanding, we need assurance of faith and hope in adversity.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what we&rsquo;re dealing with, we want to handle it, but we must wait on the Lord.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what others say, what does the Lord say? Your latter end will be greater. There is greater for you in the future than what you&rsquo;re experiencing now. You can&rsquo;t convince me that God can&rsquo;t do something.</p>
    <p>There are no impossibilities with God. All of us were in a place where it seemed impossible – But God!</p>
    <p>He brought us out. We have an assurance of faith in adversity. </p>
    <p>Romans 8:35 – No matter the situation it can&rsquo;t separate us from the love of God. We need that assurance in our lives.</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t say/do things that counteract that promise.</p>
    <p>Self-assurance can be proved false by our conduct.</p>
    <p>1 John 1:6 – Not only should my relationship with God be upright, so should my relationship with others. </p>
    <p>If I&rsquo;m seeking God for something, I&rsquo;m loving my neighbor as myself.</p>
    <p>Whenever you face a crisis, the first person to deal with is yourself. Psalm 139 – Search me and know me. God knows us – so we must be honest with the word of God. </p>
    <p>Get all bitterness and impropriety out of the way. </p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t be bitter about my situation. </p>
    <p>Never ask &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;Lord, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Trust in God.</p>
    <p>He will give you instructions.  </p>

    <h1>Begin Again – Starting Over</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image30" ><strong><img src="salvationquestion.jpg" width="200" height="130" alt="The Salvation Question"></strong></div>
    <strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  May 31, 2015
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Begin Again – Starting Over</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Philippians 3:13 -14, 1 Peter 4:12, Psalm 34:19, John 16:33, 2 Corinthians 4:7-9, Philippians 4:8</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>How do you begin again, when your life has been interrupted by disappointment, tragedy, depression? Who do I turn to? Who leads me when all around me is sinking sand.</p>
    <p>The proper responses to starting over. Something happens when you have to begin again. There will be many beginnings in our life. But there are steps to take that are crucial to starting over.</p>
    <p>Letting go – you reach a point where you must step back and release it to God. Turn it over to Jesus and stop worrying about it.</p>
    <p>In order to reach your destiny, you must let go of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People</li>
      <li>Places</li>
      <li>Things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The 1 thing that keeps you from your future is your past.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s why Paul said in <strong>Philippians 3:13 -14</strong> the he didn&rsquo;t understand it all, but the one thing that he will do is let go of what&rsquo;s behind him. You can&rsquo;t fix problems from yesterday. Move on.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to form attachments to people or things but it&rsquo;s necessary for growth. </p>
    <p>Intolerance of your present will create your future. Everything that occurs in life moves us towards our dream or away from it.</p>
    <p>Resentment – letting someone you don&rsquo;t need live rent free in your mind. You need to have your mind on Jesus.</p>
    <p>Never let anyone else, build your world for you, they will build it too small.</p>
    <p>Forget those things that are beyond.</p>
    <p>We must deal with the damage, in dealing with the damage; I must deal with me, first. </p>
    <p>I have to ask the right questions. Instead of asking, &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; We must ask, &ldquo;What do you want me to do, God?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my next step, Lord?&rdquo; </p>
    <p>You must know that God doesn&rsquo;t exempt us from trials. You will have to go through some things.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 34:19</strong> – I serve a God who delivers.  <strong>John 16:33</strong> – In God you have peace, in the world, you have trouble. I&rsquo;m an overcomer and my faith is changing my circumstances. </p>
    <p>Weeping only endures for a night. I won&rsquo;t cry forever.</p>
    <p>God prepares us, <strong>1 Peter 4:12</strong> – Stop asking why me? Why here? Why now? </p>
    <p>The difference between those who fail and those who succeed is how they handle pressure.</p>
    <p>Saints should be like tea kettles, when we get in hot water, we should be singing!</p>
    <p>God inhabits the praise of his people. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 4:7-9</strong> – We have the treasure in earthly vessels. I&rsquo;m facing all of this, but I&rsquo;m still here. Sometimes you deal with stuff all day long – but in the morning it&rsquo;s a new day. Those who cause the pain of today don&rsquo;t inherit the pleasure of tomorrow. </p>
    <p>Life isn&rsquo;t about waiting for the storm to pass – learn to dance in the rain. </p>
    <p>Release the grief, fear, anger and labels that have attached themselves to you. There is more to you than what others say about you.</p>
    <p>Do what is necessary then do what is possible – then you&rsquo;ll be able to do the impossible. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t rehearse your failures – the more you talk about it, the more it becomes a part of your life. If you love failure – you&rsquo;ll fail. Life isn&rsquo;t always going to be happy – there is no correlation between life experience and happiness. </p>
    <p>Happiness doesn&rsquo;t depend on who you are, it depends on what you think. Get up with the, &ldquo;Today is the day the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it!&rdquo; type of mindset. </p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong> – Set your mind on the positive not on the negative. Set your affections above. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t repress it – don&rsquo;t hold it in, don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s no big deal. Don&rsquo;t hold on to your words. When you hold it in you create a root of bitterness over the period of time.  You have to release it or you will end up releasing it on the wrong person. </p>
    <p>Life is not a dress-rehearsal. Stop practicing what you&rsquo;re gonna do and do nothing. <br>
      <br>
      Stop making excuses. Remember the man by the pool. He sat there for 30 + years waiting for someone to help him. You can always find an excuse. Your mouth sets the stage for your life. Your victory is as close as the roof of your mouth. </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not mourning over past mistakes – I&rsquo;m moving on. Don&rsquo;t be tormented by past mistakes. </p>
    <p>We are forgiven, sanctified and set apart. We are the blood of Jesus. Christ has forgiven you. When Christ forgives you – don&rsquo;t worry about what the world says about you. </p>
    <p>Those with the best life make the best of what they have. Take the first step - accept what you can&rsquo;t change. Tell God how you feel, not other people. </p>
    <p>Do you want to be bitter or happy? The choice is yours.</p>
    <p>Start over, don&rsquo;t be afraid. Sometimes you have to re-start 2, 3, 4, 5 times, but that won&rsquo;t stop God. Remember the doubters in Israel. God waited until all of the doubters died before the promise was received. </p>
    <p>Be determined to be all you can be in the kingdom of God. I have a new attitude, a new look, I&rsquo;m refocusing my life. I&rsquo;m the righteousness of Jesus. It&rsquo;s nothing we did. While we were in our sins, Christ died for us.</p>
    <p>Stay in the race. </p>
    <p>The race hasn&rsquo;t been given to the swift. Hold out – keep the faith in God&rsquo;s own time, my change will come.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t give up, don&rsquo;t give in, don&rsquo;t be weary.</p>
    <p>After a while what God promised, will come to pass. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Spiritual Warfare</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong>  Ephesians 6:10, 2 Corinthians 2:11, 2 Corinthians 2:13, Hebrews 5:13, John 8:31, John 16:22, 2 Corinthians 10:4, Galatians 5:17, Philippians 4:8, Colossians 1:2-3, Ephesians 4:22 – 24, Colossians 3:12, Colossians 3:9, Psalms 33:4 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Each of us will at some point encounter opposition in our lives. We must stand on the delivering word of God. </p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 6:10</strong> –<strong> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</strong> Every born again believer will encounter spiritual resistance. There is a warfare that&rsquo;s occurring that if you don&rsquo;t have the word of God, you will stumble. </p>
    <p>The word of God should be paramount in our lives. Nothing should take the place of the word of God.</p>
    <p>Many of what&rsquo;s occurring in the world is because many lack the knowledge of the word. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t blame everything on people, many times it&rsquo;s not the person, it&rsquo;s the spirit in that person. Every true believer will have opposition from the adversary.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 2:11</strong> <strong>– Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</strong> This is where you can understand your position in Christ. Demonic activity is all around us today. We have to be mindful of where our help comes from and who we are. </p>
    <p>We need the right attitude towards the truth. Spiritual discernment – <strong>2 Corinthians 2:13</strong> <strong>– I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</strong> God reveals to us the things we need to know, what we need and when to do it. We must be able to discern what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s evil. </p>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 5:13</strong> <strong>– For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</strong> Some things are evil but appear to be good. </p>
    <p>The Bible gives you the resources and power to stand. When we study, the word, the closer we get to Christ the more spiritual our eyes are. </p>
    <p>Examination + Judgment = Discernment</p>
    <p>We need to live holy lives in order to discern. <strong>John 8:31</strong> <strong>– Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed.</strong>  When we know the truth, we are free from worry, stress and the wiles of the devil. </p>
    <p>You have the peace of God – nothing has the power to steal your joy.</p>
    <p><strong>John 16:22</strong> <strong>– And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</strong> No man can take your peace or joy from you. Don&rsquo;t worry about things because you have the fruit of the spirit. When you say it – the enemy hears it. </p>
    <p>The enemy attacks groups, organizations and individuals. God lets us know in advance that if you live Godly you will suffer persecution – you are in the world, but not of it. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t expect to have a close relationship with the world. Everything that&rsquo;s worldly isn&rsquo;t good for you – from a spiritual standpoint. We must suffer – it calls for courage, determination and prayer. We need to depend on God to get us out of our situation – <strong>2 Corinthians 10:4</strong> <strong>– (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</strong> We need to know how to come against strongholds. </p>
    <p>Yes, we are saved, sanctified, Christ-like, but we are in this body. Only the spirit man loves God. <strong>Galatians 5:17</strong> <strong>– For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</strong> You can&rsquo;t do what the flesh lusts to do. The flesh is always lusting to do something else. </p>
    <p>You have the authority already. Walk in the spirit. </p>
    <p>It makes no matter who you are, we will all deal with opposition.  </p>
    <p>If there is division in the ministry we can&rsquo;t fulfill the commandment.</p>
    <p>The primary key to being an overcomer is your thought-life. Spiritual warfare occurs in your mind. We are dealing with this flesh. <strong>Ephesians 6:10</strong> <strong>– Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</strong> Be strong in the Lord. No matter what I&rsquo;m facing, I take it to God first. </p>
    <p>Secondly, I must believe that what he promised in his word will happen. Although, it doesn&rsquo;t look like it will change, I&rsquo;m focused on the word of God. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t tie Jesus down to a period of time. Whether it&rsquo;s four days or 40 years, Jesus promised it.</p>
    <p>We must keep that in our mind and spirit. Speak life and reject everything that disagrees with the word of God. </p>
    <p>If he takes something away from me it&rsquo;s only because he&rsquo;s giving me something better. I&rsquo;ll gain more than I lose. When dealing with spiritual warfare we need the word of God to be our ammunition. </p>
    <p>We take the word of God – place it in our heart and speak it. Don&rsquo;t allow the thoughts to plant seeds to influence your thinking. </p>
    <p>Keep the word of God handy. If you need an answer and you&rsquo;re serious about it, he will give you an answer. </p>
    <p>Temptation is something that tries to get you to go against the word of God. <br>
      Discipline your thought life – cast down imaginations and every high thing. Talk to Jesus – he&rsquo;s right there. </p>
    <p>A thought un-checked can become an image. You can get an image of poverty and an image of failure – Guard your heart because those things will come. </p>
    <p>If I don&rsquo;t know where I am spiritually, I don&rsquo;t know about the weapons I have. </p>
    <p>To walk in victory – get rid of negative thoughts – your life won&rsquo;t change until you change your thinking. </p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong> <strong>– Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</strong> Everything in this passage is good. There are no negative thoughts. This is what the scripture says. The thoughts will come – they will show up but we must cast it down. We can&rsquo;t hinder the thoughts – those are the fiery darts of the wicked. </p>
    <p>Recognize who the enemy is and his tactics. We could discuss spiritual warfare for a year because that&rsquo;s how the enemy is. </p>
    <p>Strongholds are a mindset that accepts situations as unchangeable even when its contrary to the world of God. </p>
    <p>You can have a stronghold by a damaging influence of someone who left your life – Satan will use that to hold us emotionally captive to develop negative attitudes like anger and bitterness. </p>
    <p>Your connection to Christ – we have a connection. <strong>Colossians 1:2-3</strong> <strong>– </strong><strong>2&nbsp;</strong><strong>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong><br>
      <strong>3&nbsp;</strong><strong>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.</strong><br>
      Set your affections on things above. You have authority over Satan. When Jesus was resurrected he said that all power of heaven and earth belong to me.</p>
    <p>Resist the devil and he will flee from you. You are a winner!</p>
    <p>You must desire to grow spiritually – have a yearning for the word of God. </p>
    <p>The armor of God refers to the resources that Christians have to resist and fight the enemy. </p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 4:22 – 24</strong> – <strong>22&nbsp;</strong><strong>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</strong><br>
      <strong>23&nbsp;</strong><strong>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</strong><br>
      <strong>24&nbsp;</strong><strong>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</strong><br>
      There are some conversations that when you&rsquo;re born again – you shouldn&rsquo;t say. Put off the old man. We should be rightly clothed. <strong>Colossians 3:9</strong> <strong>– Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</strong> We don&rsquo;t lie to each other since we are born again.</p>
    <p><strong>Colossians 3:12 – Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering.</strong> You get to a place where you recognize the enemy&rsquo;s attacks – you don&rsquo;t lose your cool. </p>
    <p>Meek, humble, kind and forgiving. Why would I hold something against you when I need Christ to forgive me. <br>
      You must know the truth and the truth starts with God. </p>
    <p><strong>Psalms 33:4</strong> <strong>– For the word of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;is right; and all his works are done in truth.</strong>  If something is in your life that doesn&rsquo;t align with the word, get rid of it. </p>
    <p>You have the authority to address anything that hinders the work of the Lord. </p>
    <p>Take up the whole armor of God. The essence of sin is acting independently of God&rsquo;s will. </p>
    <p>Look at the story in Genesis. Eve took fatal steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yielded to her imagination – The devil enticed Eve by telling her that she would be more like God. She imagined herself to be more like God.</li>
      <li>Willfully disobeyed God – She knew what God said, but disobeyed him. Do what the Lord says. Not what&rsquo;s popular – but what God said. </li>
      <li>She brought a loved one to join her</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t yield yourself to those imaginations. Don&rsquo;t disobey God and don&rsquo;t take anyone with you. The enemy makes everything look beautiful, know the word of God.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t know the word you can&rsquo;t obey the word. </p>
    <p>You need to know how to wage spiritual warfare. </p>
    <p>Christ will use us to draw others into the Kingdom. Wherever you are shine your light. I am the light of the world. </p></div>

    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Are you Ready to Receive?</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t stop anyone from being who they want to be but we can tell them the truth. We must obey God rather than man. Man is consumed with war, crime and cataclysmic occurrences. Everyone is doing their own thing. </p>
    <p>If you have clothes to wear and one meal today you are a part of the 1/3 of the richest people in the world. That tells us that there are many people with nothing. Luck 21:25 – Signs, distress of nations, perplexity. Don&rsquo;t we see those things now? When these things come to pass – look up – your redemption is near. </p>
    <p>Revelations reveals two distinct parts of man&rsquo;s nature and future:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be beauty and peace</li>
      <li>There will be eternal damnation and an unending hell</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is life beyond the grave. The book of Revelations reveals the future. </p>
    <p>God&rsquo;s redemption is inevitable. Jesus Christ is coming again and we must be ready. </p>
    <p>2 Timothy 3 – Perilous times will come – covetous, boasters, proud and unholy. There is an enemy. We have people who look good – say they were born in the church and are lost. We were all born in sin and shapen by iniquity. </p>
    <p>Man becomes fallen prey to other Gods – media, lust of flesh, immorality – they&rsquo;re trying to change what&rsquo;s God to you. </p>
    <p>Romans – In professing themselves wise they were fools. </p>
    <p>We have a choice to make if you want to be saved. The only way to be saved is through Christ. There are thousands of religions out there but Jesus is the way, the truth and the light. </p>
    <p>It wasn&rsquo;t raining when Noah built the Ark. <br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t challenge God. </p>
    <p>You need to be on fire for God you cannot be lukewarm. He comes quickly. </p>
    <p>Righteousness is manifested in a changed life. Are you really seeking God&rdquo; Do you really love your neighbor?</p>
    <p>Doing good works – will not earn salvation. </p>
    <p>Tell your story to others. Don&rsquo;t hide it from anyone. </p>
    <p>Believe that Christ died – History<br>
    Believe that Christ died for you – Salvation</p>
    <p>Set your house in order so when Christ comes – we won&rsquo;t be ashamed of his coming. We don&rsquo;t know when – When do know that now is the time to get ready for the coming of the Lord. </p>
    <p>God gives the invitation – if you come he will fixt it, he will deliver you, he will make you clean, if you come!</p>
    <p>Christ is coming back for a church without a spot or a wrinkle. When he comes there will be no time to get ready.</p>
    <p>Be Ready Now!</p>

    <h1>Grace to Obey God</h1>

    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image32"><img src="journey.jpg" width="150" height="225" alt="journey"></div>
    <strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  June 14, 2015
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Grace to Obey God</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Mark 10:29-30, Romans 6:16, Romans 6:16, John 8:34, Acts 4, John 8:31 </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>There are all types of foolishness going on in the world but we are not of this world. John 8:31 – </p>
    <p>What liberates a person from their past? Some of us are able to move around but are bound to something or someone. Until the spirit sets them free they will be bound. Some are in prison but are freer in their minds than some who are prisoners in their home – some who are at home worshipping – signing songs about freedom but are bound. </p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re alright until they give the benediction and leave this environment they leave for a week but must return to this place to find freedom. You can masquerade as a free person, but not be free.</p>
    <p>The bondage waits for you at the door. Because of sin humanity is in a sort of slavery to sin. John 8:34 – </p>
    <p>Romans 6:16 – You are slave to what you obey. There is a choice. While they promise liberty, they themselves are slaves. </p>
    <p>Real freedom can only be realized through Christ. Acts 4 – there is no other name under heaven, not Buddha, Juddha, or Islam can save you, only Jesus can free a man from the power of sin. Every man not walking under true holiness is a slave to sin. </p>
    <p>Sin won&rsquo;t have dominion over us, because of grace. Man is free from the power and from the penalty of sin. You can&rsquo;t help yourself because you made the choice to go back under it and submit yourself to it. At his coming we will be free from the present. Right now we live in a sin filled word. When we were saved – the spirit man was saved but the flesh is still lusting. </p>
    <p>Unless you&rsquo;re in the word people can upset you with just one word, if you have more world in you than the word. </p>
    <p>Truth is not always popular – many don&rsquo;t want to hear the truth but its right and necessary. The truth shall set you free. Some know academic truth but don&rsquo;t know anything about Jesus. </p>
    <p>Pilot with all of his political authority asked, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; but he didn&rsquo;t wait on the answer. Freedom from sin is conditional. The Bible is not a buffet table. Obey those who have the rule over you. Many have accepted Christ on a conceptual basis but don&rsquo;t accept him as savior and Lord.</p>
    <p>You were bought and for. There must be a corresponding action in the life of someone claiming to be saved - your speech, actions and attitude changes. the things that are passed away, you shouldn&rsquo;t go back and pick them up.  </p>
    <p>Romans 6:16 – We are free from the pollution of sin. Be not deceived – not everyone will make it into the kingdom. <br>
      <br>
      To know the truth – you have to hear the truth. You can&rsquo;t hear the truth at home. Nothing should take precedent over loving and serving Christ.</p>
    <p>First, you have to be open to change. You can&rsquo;t continue the old life. You can&rsquo;t serve God and man. Choose ye this day. It&rsquo;s best to choose now. In order to change the first thing you must do is assume responsibility for your own life. </p>
    <p>Second, believe that you can change. Stop saying I can&rsquo;t. I made up my mind – I got out and I&rsquo;m not going back. </p>
    <p>Third, stop waiting for the ideal circumstance to come before you change. </p>
    <p><strong>3 Things that will drive you to change</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pain – Some won&rsquo;t come to Christ until they&rsquo;re on their last leg</li>
      <li>Pressure – some allow pressure to weight them down until they have to come</li>
      <li>Prospective – you can do nothing on your own.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your weaknesses never give you a view of your future. Your weakness gives you a view of what you used to be. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t exert self-effort on what&rsquo;s not profitable. It&rsquo;s time out for every man for himself. We need each other. </p>
    <p>Mark 10:29-30 – Benefits of obedience. Jesus has blessings for you for coming to him. He gives us double for our trouble. Stop waiting for the time to change. </p>
    <p>The time to change is now. </p>

    <strong>Bible Study Date:</strong>  June 10, 2015
    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Peace</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong>  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Peace is a component of the fruit of the spirit. During these times we need the peace of God that passes all understanding. We have the perfect peace of God, but the one condition is our mind must be on God. We must trust in God</p>
    <p>To walk in the truth – you first need a revelation – a spiritual understanding of God&rsquo;s wisdom. We need a regiment of faith. Without faith it is impossible to please God. Hebrews 11:6 – </p>
    <p>We are spirit beings – for us to access the peace – we need to have a relationship with Christ. Everything serves us because of our relationship with Christ. Galatians 3:26 – We become children of God by our faith in God. </p>
    <p>You have to discipline your mind because the enemy always comes to get us to focus on the word of God. No matter what you&rsquo;re facing – the enemy will try to move you from the truth. </p>
    <p>Proverbs 4 – When we walk by faith we&rsquo;re not trying to figure anything out. It&rsquo;s easy to be distracted by what we see and not hold on to what we know. Psalm 119:65 – Nothing shall offend you. You won&rsquo;t have just peace, you will have great peace. I won&rsquo;t be distracted by what happens to me or around me. </p>
    <p>When my mind is on the word of God, nothing shall offend me. We must learn to discipline ourselves to not be distracted or move from the truth that we know. Our speech, our behavior and our bodies must be disciplined so we are mindful of what plans to distract us. </p>
    <p>Proverbs 29:25 – Fear of the man brings a snare. Fear and worry are like two bookends. They become a trap for us. </p>
    <p>Everything God promised, we already have. Don&rsquo;t let fear or anxiety get you sidetracked. Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked by the when and what if&rsquo;s. We must wait on the Lord and be of good courage. When I&rsquo;m in good courage, I&rsquo;m not worried about anything else. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t let your mind wander on things that aren&rsquo;t necessary. The thoughts will come but we must know that God keeps us until it gets better. Matthew 6:33 – Whatever you need will be added, whether it&rsquo;s physical, spiritual or financial. </p>
    <p>Seek first the kingdom of God. We must live by the word of God. </p>
    <p>John 14:21 – If you love me, keep my commandments. Since June 1, look at all the things you&rsquo;ve dealt with. The bible lets us know that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers us. We must apply the truth to our lives. We must hold up the truth no matter the cost. We must trust what God said will work in our lives. There are times where it looks like it won&rsquo;t work but that&rsquo;s when we need faith.</p>
    <p>It may not look like it&rsquo;s working – God&rsquo;s word says it&rsquo;s working. Holding on to the truth will cost but stay with the truth and trust that what you&rsquo;re doing is not in vain. Each of us have reached a breaking point but have to hold on somehow. </p>
    <p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s no one around to encourage us, so we must encourage ourselves. That&rsquo;s how we live stress-free. </p>
    <p>Some things you can&rsquo;t allow into your eye-gate or ear-gate. It goes directly into your spirit. All of these things are seeds. If they are planted they manifest negativity. Have the spirit of discernment to know who&rsquo;s saying what. Maintain peace by staying in Christ. </p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:1 – Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ</strong></p>
    <p>We have Peace</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peace with God and </li>
      <li>Peace from God </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Saints of God should never reach a point where we don&rsquo;t give God the praise. Don&rsquo;t be surprised by tribulation, tribulation worketh patience. Have a mindset and discipline to praise God no matter the situation. In order to have peace, I must be obedient to his word. </p>
    <p>Peace is your birthright. Every born again believer has peace in times of sickness, in times of hardship and in times of pressure, we have peace. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s available but it&rsquo;s up to us to access it. God tells us how to get the peace. We must maintain a positive attitude and understand the purpose of difficulty. </p>
    <p>When we walk in the spirit and heed the word, everything that comes into our life God has under control. Understand the value of difficulty.</p>
    <p>James 1:2 – What is your attitude when you endure difficulty. Don&rsquo;t allow negative things to be spoken. Block out negativity. The adversary knows that he was defeated. </p>
    <p>James 4:7 – Watch your language and have perseverance. Perseverance will always outlast persecution but you must hold on. Isaiah – they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be weary in weaknesses. Keep being obedient. Don&rsquo;t move away from holiness. You will reap if you faint not. 2 Corinthians 4:19 – God doesn&rsquo;t leave us in our affliction. It&rsquo;s only for a magnet. God says the afflictions as light. If God says the afflictions are light – they are light.   </p>
    <p>It depends on who&rsquo;s obeying his word. The word of God has already told us to cast our cares on him and wait for the Lord to bring positive experiences to our life. Wait for God. He will hasten his word to perform it. He&rsquo;s always on time and he comes when I want him to.</p>
    <p>The answer is there but we need to get into the position to receive what he has for us. The answer was there before the problem showed up. Ephesians 1:3 – All of God&rsquo;s promises are &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amen&rdquo;. Never say that God doesn&rsquo;t mean for you to have something. When you say that you cancel out the promise. Why would he promise something if he doesn&rsquo;t want us to have it. </p>
    <p>God won&rsquo;t go against his word – death and life is in the power of the tongue. There&rsquo;s power in our speech. <br>
      <br>
      The problem may intensify, but don&rsquo;t say contrary things. Walk by faith and not by sight. His ways are higher than our ways. We must have faith and God will supply all of our needs. </p>
    <p>We mature with perseverance. When you&rsquo;re in the situation (physical, circumstance, family and community) control your attitude. If not, I can&rsquo;t expect to receive anything.</p>
    <p>A double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. I could be doing things in the ministry but if I&rsquo;m double minded it does no good. If I&rsquo;m trusting – then not trusting you are double-minded. </p>
    <p>Job 5:19 -22 – Say those things that God says. When you&rsquo;re facing things don&rsquo;t lose your joy since he&rsquo;s already promised to deliver us and hide us from negativity.</p>
    <p>God will hid you from them. Let them talk all they want – it will not bother you. </p>
    <p>Not only will he hide us – we&rsquo;ll be saying what God said – Set your mind. You can never leave a thought without embracing a new thought. </p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t leave thoughts of hurt and disappointment without going to good thoughts. Joshua 1:8 – Replace negative thoughts by thinking on what God has done int eh past. Think on his record. </p>
    <p>Nothing is too hard for God. He did it before. Is there anything too hard for God?</p>
    <p>You really have to discipline your speech, don&rsquo;t verbalize those thoughts. You can&rsquo;t prevent negative thoughts from coming but we don&rsquo;t have to receive it. Negative thoughts are the fiery darts of the wicked. </p>
    <p>Obey God without full understanding, that&rsquo;s what faith is. Be willing to endure short term discomfort. Some days will be bad but fill your life with scripture, prayer and worship. When we have the peace of God, we have security.</p>
    <p>All things work for our good because we love the Lord. I don&rsquo;t have to see it working to know it&rsquo;s working. </p>
    <p>Block out negativity – don&rsquo;t receive it. We have the promises of God. See the benefits of trials and joys. </p>
    <p>He will bring it to pass. If it takes longer than I can see, I don&rsquo;t have to do anything to go against God&rsquo;s word. Do what God does. IF he says wait – don&rsquo;t move. If God says wait, wait. </p>
    <p>The power of Christ is more important than freedom from pain. Count it all joy.</p>
    <p>Joy isn&rsquo;t happiness, its hope and unshakable confidence in God and the presence of God in the midst of suffering.    </p>
    <p>Sometimes the pain/circumstance isn&rsquo;t bad but when you give it all of your time it stays on your mind and becomes in your spirit. </p>
    <p>Set your affections on things above. </p>

    <h1>Faith in Healing</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Bible Study Date:</strong>  June 17, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image43"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Faith in Healing</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong>  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Isaiah 55:4-5 – with his stripes we are healed because Christ took the sins of the world upon himself, so we don&rsquo;t have to bear the sin anymore.</p>
    <p>There is no sickness that comes from Christ. It contradicts the word. John 10:10 – sickness comes from lack of knowledge and other reasons. Why would Christ place sickness on us?</p>
    <p>Provisions have been made to keep Christians immune from sickness and to give the Christian power to heal.  </p>
    <p>Psalm 34:9-10 – We must have reverence of God. There is no want for healing or for being delivered from sin. If I&rsquo;m walking upright before God, loving my neighbor and loving God I don&rsquo;t have to want for anything because God provides for us. </p>
    <p>We shouldn&rsquo;t worry. Philippians 4:19 – If I&rsquo;m in need of healing, my God supplies all of our needs. God supplies the need to overcome temptation and the power to heal others.</p>
    <p>James 5:14-16 – Those who know the word of God, those who have faith, can heal the sick. The Lord shall raise him up and forgive any sin. Faith moves God. </p>
    <p>Hebrews 11:6 – Before we pray, we pray with the faith that God will supply whatever we ask. </p>
    <p>When we talk of healing and deliverance from sin – we have already been delivered from the bondage of sin. Being free and living in that freedom are two different things. </p>
    <p>When you pray – never say if it be thy will concerning anything you asked that is in his word. If it&rsquo;s his will then it&rsquo;s his will and we must agree with the will of God. </p>
    <p>Mark 11:23 – this verse transcends position. Whosoever – means if you are in Christ then you have the promise. You need a disciplined mind and spirit, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s going on – believe it. Circumstances can bring doubt but don&rsquo;t doubt it in your heart. You will have it. </p>
    <p>Faith is absolute dependence on what God said. Believing what God said. I don&rsquo;t allow what my eyes see to determine what my heart believes. I&rsquo;m believing God. Have absolute dependence on God. Hebrews 11 – talks about faith and absolute dependence. </p>
    <p>Matthew 8:8 – Speak the word only and my servant will be healed. Find scripture and repetitiously verbalize it. When we verbalize &ldquo;God come by here&rdquo;, it shows a lack of knowledge. Pray according to the word of God. The adversary listens to what we say.</p>
    <p>Heaven agrees with what the saints say. </p>
    <p>If you get to a place where you&rsquo;re dealing with something that&rsquo;s contrary. If I say, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t get better&rdquo; then Christ agrees with you and it doesn&rsquo;t get any better. Why would Solomon put in Proverbs &ldquo;Death and life are in the power of the tongue&rdquo;? This verse is in the Bible two times. So it&rsquo;s important. Be careful what you say. When we go to God, we have to have that kind of confidence.</p>
    <p>1 John 5:14 – You should never get to a point where you stop growing. We are always learning.</p>
    <p>If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. What you ask must align with the word of God.<br>
      <br>
      We don&rsquo;t need to scream, yell or anything God hears us.</p>
    <p>Before we make our requests – he knows what we&rsquo;re going to ask. The petition that I desire – we need the confidence and patience to not say anything contradictory to what we already ask.</p>
    <p>If you pray for something and it&rsquo;s been a few days or weeks, don&rsquo;t allow yourself to say that God won&rsquo;t do it. We need the absolute dependence and reliance on God. </p>
    <p><strong>4 Secrets to Answered Prayers</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faith in God – unlimited without limiting and qualifying God&rsquo;s will to what you want – John 15:7 – If God&rsquo;s word abides in us we aren&rsquo;t going to make off the wall requests. Romans 8:26 – Ask in faith, believing. </li>
      <li>Please God – 1 John 3:21 – 22 whatever we ask we receive because we keep his commandments.</li>
      <li>Come to God with the right attitude – Philippians 4:5-6 – you need the right motives. We have needs and we have desires. God meets both desires and needs. A child of God shouldn&rsquo;t be lacking. Philippians 4:5-6 – Never approach God in prayer with apprehension. When we pray and we seek God for something, I&rsquo;m praising God for it. We need an attitude of praise, in all these things; I&rsquo;m more than a conqueror. Prophesize those things. God is on my side, I have no fear. We come to God with the right attitude. </li>
      <li>Believe that he is – God doesn&rsquo;t hear the prayers of sinners but he hears his peoples voices. The only prayer a sinner can pray is one of repentance. Once they have repented they can ask for whatever they want.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow thoughts of past actions to limit what you seek in God. Christians shouldn&rsquo;t suffer, we shouldn&rsquo;t be poor.</p>
    <p>Psalm 37:1- This is the mindset of us. We shouldn&rsquo;t worry about what others do and we must trust in the Lord. Psalm 37:7 – rest in God and don&rsquo;t worry about what others have or what they&rsquo;re doing. We don&rsquo;t suffer failures in business. Psalm 1:3 – Whatever you place your hand on will prosper. We should not be suffering from bad habits. </p>
    <p>1 Corinthians 6:9 – any child of God with these habits must immediately rid themselves of these behaviors. That&rsquo;s not in our character. </p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to worry. Worry is a demonstration of a lack of faith. Denounce all worry and use our spiritual weapons. 2 Corinthians 10:4 – We are in constant warfare. As long as we are in this body we will deal with it all but all we have to do is live in it and walk in it.</p>
    <p>We all get to the place where we let our guard down.</p>
    <p>God lays out his plan for us. It&rsquo;s laid out in his word. We are lead by the spirit. God won&rsquo;t accept excuses for not doing what he told us to do. He gave us all the resources needed but we must discipline our bodies and discipline our speech. </p>
    <p>Everyday we have 24 hours its how you utilize it. We must organize our lies to keep Christ as #1 in our lives. Jesus is first. We have to submit to God&rsquo;s plan and will for our lives.</p>
    <p>We must have a desire for the truth in God&rsquo;s word. If I have desire for the truth I can withstand confusion. Base your choice on scripture, not experiences or emotions. Feelings can lead us away from God&rsquo;s best for us.</p>
    <p>Feelings may help you obtain good but not God&rsquo;s best. We need a willing and determined mind so I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice for Jesus. The willingness shows that you value the word of God over anything. Some of devils schemes – fear, loneliness, afflictions and rejections will try to move you.</p>
    <p>Commit it to God – In God&rsquo;s own time what he promise he&rsquo;ll bring to pass.</p>
    <p>Our lives have purpose. We are here for this time for a reason. Sometimes we may suffer rejection – don&rsquo;t worry about it. God has something better than what you&rsquo;re fretting over. We should be happy when we&rsquo;re rejected – there&rsquo;s something better out there for us. </p>

    <h1>The Evidence Must Be Visible</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  June 21, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image42"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> The Evidence Must Be Visible</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 2 Corinthians 5:15, Ephesians 4:17, 1 Corinthians 6:19, Proverbs 3:5, Ephesians 4:22, 1 John 2:29, 1 Peter 2:2, Romans 13:14, 1 John 3:9, Philippians 2:14, Proverbs 2:28 </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>If any man is in Christ he is a new creature. This being father&rsquo;s day often times we speak to the men, but this subject transcends the bounds of parenting.  A child isn&rsquo;t likely to find God until he finds God in his father. Christ must be at the center of our being – the love of Christ constrains a godly man or woman.</p>
    <p>Born again believers have undergone a spiritual transformation and a termination of self-life because you are no longer your own. <strong>2 Corinthians 5:15 – And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. </strong>Since Jesus died for us, I live for Christ. I&rsquo;m not living for the pleasures of the flesh, but for Christ.</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 4:17</strong> – <strong>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind. </strong>Put away the old life. Man&rsquo;s sinfulness flows out of a reverberated mind. A mind that hasn&rsquo;t been transformed. This type of mind makes it possible for a person to sit in Bible Study, hear the word and shoot people.</p>
    <p>Reverberated mind is not of God. A transformation of your mind must occur. </p>
    <p>We have a different view of people once you are in Christ. We have new desires, new purposes and new principles, because we are born again.</p>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong> - <strong>20 - What? Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body&rdquo; for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&rsquo;s. </strong>You are not your own; new desires, principles and purpose.</p>
    <p>When you look at scripture it tells you that you are the temple of God. Since you are God&rsquo;s temple, you can&rsquo;t fill it with junk. </p>
    <p>God dwells in us. When we get to the place where we need new direction we must trust God. <strong>Proverbs 3:5</strong> – <strong>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. </strong>Directing your own path will have you with the wrong people at the wrong time. </p>
    <p>The word of God gives instruction for our lives. <strong>Ephesians 4:22</strong> – <strong>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts. </strong>Put off the old man, put on the new man. Speak every man truth with his neighbor. We are members of the same body. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fantastic if we could get to a place where we realize that we don&rsquo;t live for ourselves?</p>
    <p>The new creature learns, hears and is taught the word. Without spiritual enlightenment we are in our sins. We need to be in Bible Study, hear the word of God and understand that without the word we are lost.  </p>
    <p>The quality of your preparation determines the quality of your performance. </p>
    <p>There has to be a change. You can&rsquo;t put off anything without putting on something. <strong>Romans 13:14</strong> – <strong>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. </strong>Don&rsquo;t give the flesh opportunity to fulfill the lust.</p>
    <p>There is evidence of putting on Christ. If you&rsquo;re a Christian people should know it without you having to walk around with a Bible in your hands. <strong>1 John 2:29</strong> – <strong>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born in him.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:9</strong> – <strong>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. </strong>Do not repeat the same sin if you&rsquo;re born of God.</p>
    <p>Love one another – result of a new birth. Desire the sincere milk of the word. <strong>1 Peter 2:2</strong> – <strong>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby</strong>. You need the time in the word before you spend time with the world. </p>
    <p>If the Holy Spirit isn&rsquo;t controlling you, then you are one step a way from doing something crazy.</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 2:14</strong> -.<strong>Do all things without murmuring and disputings. </strong>Do all things without murmuring. Put off retaliation. Put off getting even. Avenge not yourself. Discipline yourself to wait on the Lord. Be still and know that I&rsquo;m God.</p>
    <p>In Christ you shouldn&rsquo;t lose your temper. Be slow to anger. Put off having a critical spirit. Judge not lest ye be judged. </p>
    <p>Saints don&rsquo;t have a critical spirit. If you&rsquo;re not in charge of the group, don&rsquo;t criticize the leader.</p>
    <p>Put off disrespect for authority. Remember them who have rule over you. If you&rsquo;re not satisfied with what leadership is doing pray for them. </p>
    <p>Purpose to allow the spirit to teach you with new things. </p>

    <h1>Spiritual Growth Part 2</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  July 5, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image41"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hosea 4: 6, John 12:28, 1 Peter 2:2, Psalm 119:33, 2 Peter 1:11, Romans 8:28, Romans 5:3, James 1:2 , Proverbs 17:9, Proverbs 26:17, Proverbs 26:20, Proverbs 26:21, Ecclesiastes 7:20    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p> Spiritual growth is possible but you need to know how to grow. There are people who don&rsquo;t know about the spirit. <strong>Hosea 4: 6 </strong><strong>– My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. </strong>When you forget about God you put yourself in a precarious situation. <strong>John 12:28 </strong><strong>– &nbsp;Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</strong></p>
    <p>There is a day where we all will have to stand before the judgment of Christ.<strong>1 Peter 2:2</strong><strong> – As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</strong> You have to get a hunger for the word of God. The physical body you can over eat and become overweight but too much of the word makes you spiritually strong. The word renews our strength.<br>
      <br>
      Cultivate your understanding of the truth. You can hear it but you must understand it. Have an attitude of change, a transformed mind. <strong>Psalm 119:33 </strong><strong>– Teach me, O&nbsp;Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</strong> Order my steps in your word. Give me understanding and I shall keep your law. The law of God is different from the law of the land. I shall observe it with my whole heart. My contentment and happiness comes from the ability to discern spiritual truth to apply to my situation. Every spirit is not of God. You need discernment to judge the evidence that&rsquo;s before you.</p>
    <p>Since we are the light of the world we are supposed to take the truth and share it with the world. The world needs the saints to be the witness so others will know. Let your light shine before men. The Holy Spirit will guide you to the truth but you need the right attitude. </p>
    <p>Guidance is given to the humble. </p>
    <p>When you look at obedience – obedience is a higher priority than religious acts. We can&rsquo;t be obedient in one area and disobedient in another. Spiritual growth assures an abundant life. </p>
    <p>Abundant life isn&rsquo;t dependent upon material things. Abundant life is abundant peace, abundant joy and abundant contentment. When you seek the kingdom make that a priority and all things will be added.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t love the world or the things of the world.<strong> 2 Peter 1:11 – For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. </strong>Be committed to the gospel. You shall never fall – there is no failure in Christ. <br>
      <br>
      Spiritual growth is a choice. Change is inevitable – growth is optional. You don&rsquo;t have to grow. <br>
      To grow you must control your emotions and moods. When I control my attitude, I can understand the value in difficult times. <strong>Romans 8:28 </strong>– It doesn&rsquo;t look good but you have to have the faith to believe that it&rsquo;s working for your good. </p>
    <p><strong>James 1:2 - My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</strong><strong> Romans 5:3 - And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience. </strong><strong> </strong>Glory in tribulation.</p>
    <p>Keys to spiritual Growth</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Avoid negative self-talk – Stop saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Watch the conversations you have with yourself. Look in the mirror when you feel like speaking negative to yourself it will discourage you. Words are spirit and life. The more effort you make the more you will have. Galatians 6:7-9 – Don&rsquo;t get weary. Keep on trying even when you get tired. Put 1 foot in front of the other and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Talk to yourself. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Things that disrupt good friendships and remove you from God&rsquo;s anointing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t repeat everything. (<strong>Proverbs 17:9</strong>) A lot of friendships have been destroyed. <strong>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.</strong></li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t meddle in affairs that aren&rsquo;t your own – it&rsquo;s none of your business.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t be a mess magnet (<strong>Proverbs 26:17</strong>) <strong>- He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</strong></li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t be a tale bearer (<strong>Proverbs 26:20</strong>) <strong>- Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</strong></li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t overstay your welcome (<strong>Proverbs 26:21</strong>) – A negative attitude discourages other people. You can&rsquo;t grow in an environment like that. <strong>As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.</strong></li>
      <li>Recognize your past condition – don&rsquo;t judge. (<strong>Ecclesiastes 7:20</strong>) <strong>For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. </strong>All have sinned and come short of God&rsquo;s glory. By the grace of God and his mercy. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We should never get to a point in our lives where we don&rsquo;t need to grow.  </p>

    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image40"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 Peter 2:2, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:5, John 10:10, 2 Peter 1:4, Philippians 4:10, Ephesians 3:16, 1 Corinthians 15:58, 2 Corinthians 4:18, 2 Corinthians 4:8-9, John 16:33, Philippians 4:8, Job 5:19, Philippians 4:11, Hebrews 13:5, Psalm 45:1, Ephesians 1:15, 2 Corinthians 2:14, Hebrews 10:32, Hebrews 10:35-36, Hebrews 10:36, Psalm 125:1, Psalm 62:5, Psalm 40:1, Romans 8:28, Isaiah 41:9-10, 1 John 4:1 
    <p><br>
    <strong>1 Peter 2:2</strong> – <strong>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. </strong>Desire sincere milk<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong> <strong>– According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.</strong> The need for spiritual growth. Right now each 1 of us has access to all we need to live a Christ-like, Holy life. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Peter 1:4</strong> <strong>– Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</strong> We have escaped the temptation to be removed from the word of God. We have all we need. <strong>John 10:10</strong> – Means we should have more than enough of what we need. Peace, love, joy, self-control. <strong>Philippians 4:10</strong> – <strong>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. </strong>God shall supply our needs. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>2 Peter 1:5</strong> <strong>– And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge.</strong> If we follow God&rsquo;s word and do what&rsquo;s instructed of us, we will never be defeated. We will be strengthened. <strong>Ephesians 3:16 – That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.</strong> The inner man is the spirit man. The outer man may be weak but the inner man is spiritual.  The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. We must always maintain a positive attitude. Everyday won&rsquo;t be perfect but we serve a perfect God.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>1 Corinthians 15:58</strong> <strong>– Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</strong> Nowhere in the Bible tells us to be steadfast and unmovable. When I get the knowledge I know that what I&rsquo;m doing isn&rsquo;t in vain. <strong>2 Corinthians 4:18</strong> <strong>– While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</strong> When I&rsquo;m in affliction I know that deliverance is on the way. Don&rsquo;t move away from what you know. </p>
    <p><br>
      There may be times where you&rsquo;re praying and waiting and wondering, &ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; <strong>2 Corinthians 4:8-9 - 8&nbsp;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9&nbsp;Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      Remain steadfast. There are times when physically we are weak but he renews our strength and restores the joy of our salvation.</p>
    <p><br>
      The enemy will try to convince you that you can&rsquo;t enjoy life. <strong>John 16:33</strong> – <strong>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</strong> We will have trials but he has overcome the world.</p>
    <p> <br>
      <strong><u>2 Things to do</u></strong><br>
      - Get your mind off your problem and place it on God. Do not concentrate on the problem but who can solve it.</p>
    <p><br>
      - Get your mouth off your problems – You may say something that increases the problem. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Job 5:19</strong> – <strong>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</strong> He shall deliver thee. When destruction is all around us, the joy of the Lord is our strength. Maintain a positive attitude, always. It takes discipline to do that. <strong>Philippians 4:8</strong> – <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Philippians 4:11</strong> <strong>– Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</strong> I learned to be content. Wait on the Lord and be of good courage. While I&rsquo;m waiting, I&rsquo;m receiving strength and instruction. There are times when we must stop moving around and trying to fix the situation. If I commit it to God, I must trust him to work it out. <br>
      If I cast my cares, I&rsquo;m not going back to see how the cares are addressed. <br>
      The same God that told Moses to stretch out his rod to part the Red Sea is the same God right now in 2015. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Hebrews 13:5 – Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. </strong>Stay away from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have. God teaches us how to be content with what we have. If I&rsquo;m content with what I have, it&rsquo;s my responsibility to manage what I have. <br>
      We have authority in the earth. <strong>Psalm 45:1</strong> – My tongue is the pen of the ready writer. Whatsoever you say. You need a revelation to get out of the predicaments.<br>
      <strong>Ephesians 1:15</strong> <strong>– Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints.</strong> We have the spirit of revelation – we can then analyze things from a spiritual point of view. Everything begins with the word of God.<br>
      We have power over demonic forces but we must trust God. The knowledge of God boosts confidence. The love of God causes everything to work for you. <strong>2 Corinthians 2:14 – Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. </strong>I know what God will do and I won&rsquo;t let anyone change my mind. I&rsquo;m trusting and waiting on his promises. If he did it before, he will do it again.</p>
    <p><br>
    He always leads us to victory. If you&rsquo;re a winner today – you&rsquo;re a winner tomorrow. You were a winner before the circumstance. The circumstance knows when it comes that you&rsquo;re going against a winner.</p>
    <p><br>
      Knowledge produces confidence. <strong>Hebrews 10:32</strong> – <strong>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions. </strong>Affliction came but you had the revelation so you could endure it. <strong>Hebrews 10:35-36 – 35&nbsp;Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. 36&nbsp;For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</strong><br>
      The blessing is there if I have the confidence. Proverbs – guard your heart – never allow your mind to dwell on negativity and you will guard your heart. <br>
    Re-read <strong>Hebrews 10:36</strong> for the next 5 days.</p>
    <p><br>
      After I&rsquo;ve done what I&rsquo;ve been instructed to do, I can&rsquo;t be moved by circumstances! Don&rsquo;t be moved. </p>
    <p><br>
      Circumstances don&rsquo;t change me. <strong>Psalm 62:5</strong> – <strong>My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. </strong>Whatever I need comes from God. I won&rsquo;t be moved. He is my defense, my security and my protection. I shall not be moved. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Psalm 125:1</strong> <strong>– They that trust in the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever.</strong> When I trust in God, I can&rsquo;t be moved. </p>
    <p><br>
      There are times when you need to encourage yourself. You must prophesize to yourself by looking at what God has already done. <strong>Psalm 40:1</strong> – <strong>I waited patiently for the&nbsp;Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</strong> I waited for God – he brought me out; then other people saw it and they started trusting in God. They knew your situation and saw that you didn&rsquo;t break. Your testimony and your witness shows them God&rsquo;s power. By your actions and presence, you testify.</p>
    <p><br>
      The problem hasn&rsquo;t been solved yet, I&rsquo;m dealing with it today but in God&rsquo;s own time. My ways are not your ways. Just know that it&rsquo;s working. <strong>Romans 8:28</strong> – <strong>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. </strong>It may not look like it&rsquo;s working, but I have faith to believe its working. While it&rsquo;s working I&rsquo;m praising. <br>
      God is God and we are not!</p>
    <p><br>
      God does what he does and we must have the confidence to believe in him. <br>
      Don&rsquo;t throw away your confidence. Trust in God. Know that he&rsquo;s there. We are chosen and anointed. <strong>Isaiah 41:9-10</strong> – <strong>9&nbsp;Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. 10&nbsp;Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      God will strengthen, help and hold us up. So when the enemy is expecting us to fall, God strengthens us. He gives us strength to deal with what we go through.<br>
      We need the knowledge because there are other spirits out there. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>1 John 4:1</strong> – <strong>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. </strong></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t believe every spirit, try the spirit to see if it&rsquo;s of God.<br>
      You are a winner now, not a loser!<br>
      You&rsquo;re the head and not the tail, you are above and not beneath. </p>

    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 15:4, Psalm 81:11, Proverbs 3:5, 1 Corinthians 10:23, Ephesians 4:22, Philippians 1:6 1 Peter 2:12, Romans 8:29, Romans 8:37, 2 Corinthians 3:17 – 18, Romans 15:4, 1 Peter 5:10, James 1:3, Hebrews 10:6, James 1:2, Luke 10:19, 2 Corinthians 2:15, Psalm 62:6, Psalm 125:1 <br>
      <strong><br>
      Sermon Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
    Spiritual Growth is not only a large area of discuss but it&rsquo;s something that we all need to do. Grow in the grace and the knowledge of God. The ability to grow is in every believer but the potential to grow doesn&rsquo;t guarantee fruitfulness. We must grow in love, knowledge, holiness and faith.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>John 15:4</strong> <strong>– Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</strong> In order to grow and bear fruit we must be in Christ. All that we have no, there is nothing else that god needs to create for us, but we need to grow in the knowledge of what we have so when things happen, don&rsquo;t contradict what God says. Discipline your mind and your speech.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Psalm 81:11</strong> <strong>– But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. </strong>No good thing will he withhold if I walk upright before God, love my neighbor doesn&rsquo;t prevent us from having to deal with trials and life&rsquo;s issues.</p>
    <p><br>
      During sickness and sorrow – don&rsquo;t throw up your hands. God has already told us what to do. <strong>Proverbs 3:5</strong> <strong>– Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. </strong>Don&rsquo;t get distracted by situations – continue to trust him even when it seems like he won&rsquo;t answer our prayers.<br>
      Job didn&rsquo;t give credit to the enemy and he said he would come forth as pure gold because of his trials. That attitude is essential for a victorious life.</p>
    <p><br>
      We need spiritual maturity – Have a positive attitude if I want to grow. When I mature in the word. <strong>Ephesians 4:22</strong> <strong>– That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.</strong> Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to respond to situations before Christ. <strong>Philippians 1:6</strong> <strong>– Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. </strong>Don&rsquo;t give negative thoughts life by speaking it. When you put words in the air you give life to what you say.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>1 Corinthians 10:23</strong> <strong>– All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</strong> Govern your speech. How do your actions affect other people? When we get to situations in our lives we should discipline our mind and speech. All things that we do must have edification. Some things we do that are lawful may impact someone else in a negative manner.</p>
    <p><br>
      Growing spiritually will get us to a place where we know what to do. We can discern what is proper and what is not.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Before you do something, you must ask yourself the following questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will it damage your influence?</li>
      <li>Will it take away from my ability?</li>
      <li>Will people not trust me?</li>
      <li>Will I be a violent point of reference?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1 Peter 2:12 – Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. </strong>You should have honest conversations amongst those who are saved. No matter how they speak about us, our conversation must be honest.</p>
    <p><br>
      The essential element of spiritual growth is to become more like Christ. That&rsquo;s why we continue to grow to be more like Christ. <strong>Romans 8:29</strong> <strong>– For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. </strong>When we look at this passage we&rsquo;re destined to be in the image of Christ. We&rsquo;re called, justified and glorified.</p>
    <p><br>
      When that becomes a reality in our lives then we can boldly say – If God be for us, who can be against us? Whatever I&rsquo;m dealing with, I don&rsquo;t say negative stuff. <strong>Romans 8:37</strong> <strong>– For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. </strong>We are more than conquerors, no matter the magnitude of the situation, I&rsquo;m more than a conqueror through Christ. I get my direction and instruction through him. I&rsquo;m more than a conqueror through him. </p>
    <p><br>
      We need to have the faith to believe it. Jesus didn&rsquo;t say we needed great faith, he said we need faith the size of a mustard seed? Do you know how small a mustard seed is? See picture below. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2 Corinthians 3:17 – 18</strong> – <strong>17&nbsp;</strong><strong>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.18&nbsp;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</strong> <br>
      It makes no difference what you do, God loves us just the same as he did before. Where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. The Holy Spirit dwells in us. As spiritual growth occurs in our lives, we change. The more you learn about Christ the more you change. </p>
    <p><br>
      There are things you can handle now that you couldn&rsquo;t handle five years ago because you weren&rsquo;t on the level of Christ. Five years ago you would&rsquo;ve gone crazy but now we know what to say and what not to say.<br>
      God causes us to grow spiritually. That&rsquo;s why the word of God helps us grow, it equips us.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Romans 15:4</strong> <strong>– For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. </strong>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. We are able to see examples to follow from the Bible. We have to keep the word in the midst of our hearts to make it through trials.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>1 Peter 5:10</strong> <strong>– But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. </strong>He called us. I quickly move from the suffering when I read this verse. Set my mind on being perfect, settled and stablished. </p>
    <p><br>
      This tells me that the suffering I&rsquo;m dealing with won&rsquo;t be forever. It&rsquo;s not the end. I&rsquo;m coming out of it. He&rsquo;s going to strengthen me. </p>
    <p><br>
      Suffering no longer has a shattering affect because God keeps us.<br>
      When you&rsquo;re going through something don&rsquo;t dwell on it. We can persevere if we grow spiritually. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>James 1:3</strong> <strong>– Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</strong> I gotta let patience have her perfect work. <strong>James 1:2 – My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations. </strong>Count it all joy. This comes from growing in the word. </p>
    <p><br>
      Our faith will be tried but everything that happens to us – there&rsquo;s a purpose. <br>
      <strong>Hebrews 10:6</strong> <strong>– In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. </strong>You have need of patience until the promise shows up.<br>
      We can&rsquo;t doubt because doubt cancels everything. Think about what you say before you say it.</p>
    <p><br>
      We must repent when we speak badly. We can speak to him like he&rsquo;s our father. When you say something that goes against the word of God you can say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I said that, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><br>
      Once we confess it God forgets it as if you never said it.<br>
      We have authority, but we must recognize our authority through the covenant of Christ. Everything begins with the word of God.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Luke 10:19</strong> <strong>– Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. </strong>We have the authority over demonic forces. Resist the devil and he will flee. We need confidence in the word of God. The knowledge of God&rsquo;s love for you produces confidence.</p>
    <p><br>
      I&rsquo;m a winner – never see yourself as a loser. <strong>2 Corinthians 2:15 – For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</strong> We always are lead to triumph. The more you are in the word, the more you love the word. The closer you are to God. </p>
    <p><br>
      The further away you are from distractions it&rsquo;s the word of God. <br>
      We need to have the confidence. So we aren&rsquo;t moved by circumstances. With confidence I&rsquo;m not moved by circumstances. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Psalm 62:6</strong> <strong>– He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. </strong> I&rsquo;m not depending on anyone. He is my rock. He only!<br>
      I shall not be moved. No matter what happens, I won&rsquo;t be moved from my place in Christ he is my rock and salvation. </p>
    <p><br>
      He is my deliverer, healer and my all.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Psalm 125:1</strong> <strong>– They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. </strong>Those who trust in the Lord are like Mt. Zion who cannot be moved!</p>
    <p><br>
      You&rsquo;re a winner right now!</p>
    <p><br>
      There is no demon that can take that title from me. We need to see the enemy as he is – a defeated foe. <br>
      <br>
      He was defeated at Calvary. <br>
      <br>
      The blood still works, it will never lose its power.<br>
      <br>
      We must apply the word!</p>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 12, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image38"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Exodus 15:26, Joshua 1: 8, Psalm 119-97, 1 Corinthians 1:5, Ephesians 4:14, 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 3:18, Jeremiah 10:23, Romans 5:1 <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>You need the right soil and water to grow. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living water, if you thirst come to me and drink.&rdquo; Spiritual growth is a choice. Change is inevitable, but growth is optional. Choose this day who ye will serve. As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</p>
    <p><br>
      Winning is a choice. It&rsquo;s by your attitude, acts of obedience and commitment to God.</p>
    <p><br>
      There must be a willingness to learn. <strong>Exodus 15:26 – And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;that healeth thee. </strong>I&rsquo;m the Lord that healeth thee – some of the things that people are struggling with shouldn&rsquo;t occur. Some things we struggle with we shouldn&rsquo;t. We must purpose to live an abundant life. We have abundant peace when others are crazy, abundant joy when others are sad. <strong>Joshua 1: 8 – This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </strong>Meditate on the word day and night. </p>
    <p><br>
    If God says that you&rsquo;ll make your way prosperous if you meditate on the word, it will happen. Speak faith filled words. Stop saying it&rsquo;s too hard, I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have – God supplies all of our needs. </p>
    <p><br>
      The word is alive. Take the word and apply it to your life. <br>
    There are times when you can&rsquo;t trust yourself, but you must ask God to order your steps. </p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Psalm 119-97 – O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</strong> We can&rsquo;t miss it. Don&rsquo;t love the world. You can&rsquo;t have a piece of the world and piece of the kingdom. </p>
    <p><br>
    I hate every false way. If it doesn&rsquo;t lead to life eternal, I hate that way. <strong>1 Corinthians 1:5 – That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge.</strong> When I was a child, I spake as a child, but when I became a man, I put away all childish things. </p>
    <p><br>
      Grow in understanding; we develop ourselves into spiritual maturity. <strong>Ephesians 4:14 – That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. </strong> Every teaching that comes along isn&rsquo;t right. There are false teachers all around. As long as you know the truth you won&rsquo;t accept everything. </p>
    <p><br>
      If you deal with something and every so often you&rsquo;re overcome by it – don&rsquo;t make provisions for it.</p>
    <p><br>
      When you&rsquo;re tempted there&rsquo;s a way out – You can&rsquo;t say, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. You can be tempted, but don&rsquo;t provide opportunities for sin to live in your life.<br>
    We have all the resources right now to live an abundant life. <strong>2 Peter 1:3 – According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. </strong>You have it, but you need the knowledge to know that you have an abundant life.</p>
    <p><br>
    He has blessed us. We must abide in him and let his word abide in us. That&rsquo;s why some are struggling. They&rsquo;re trying to make it without Jesus. If you&rsquo;re at the same place you were at last year, something is wrong.</p>
    <p><br>
      God gives special care to us. Ask and it is given, seek and ye shall find.<br>
    Live in me, trust in me and wait for me. Some don&rsquo;t want to wait.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>2 Peter 3:18 – But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. </strong>You have to make an effort to grow. Talk to God before talking to anyone else. There is a whole lot of stuff waiting for you at the door. You must have a talk with Jesus first thing in the morning. I need the word more than my necessary food. <br>
      We need the God-kind of faith that works by love. Love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus didn&rsquo;t say it depends on the behavior of your neighbor. <br>
      We need to break free of our bad habits.<br>
      Spiritual Growth – means to discern between truth and error and apply the word to my life. </p>
    <p><br>
      Whenever I got to God, I ask him to open my eyes so I may grow from you.<br>
      Spiritual maturity – means that you&rsquo;re able to come to a place of knowing.<br>
  <strong>Jeremiah 10:23 – O&nbsp;Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</strong> Put away carnal things and grow in the spirit. When I grow in Christ. When these things come I&rsquo;m able to withstand. I&rsquo;m secure. So secure that if there is nothing in the house to eat, I set the table anyhow.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Romans 5:1 – Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> We are justified by faith. We have peace with God and we have access. Tribulation worketh patience. Watch when you ask for patience – tribulation worketh patience. </p>
    <p><br>
      Be careful what you ask for. <br>
      <br>
      You&rsquo;re a winner right now!<br>
      <br>
      You&rsquo;re blessed right now!<br>
      <br>
      Your standing in Christ is secure but your state in Christ is progressive.<br>
      <br>
      You can tell when you&rsquo;re not as close to God as you need to be. To grow, discipline your mind and your actions. Learn how to praise in the midst of. Bless the Lord in the midst of circumstances. <br>
      <br>
      Let nothing separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus.<br>
      Forget about what&rsquo;s behind. Don&rsquo;t let the enemy weigh your mind down with the past. What&rsquo;s before you is better than what&rsquo;s behind you.<br>
      <br>
      You have the victory but you must love this word. God is first.</p>

    <h1>Do you want to get better?</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 19, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image37"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 5:4, Proverbs 4:20, Romans 8:28 <br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Do you want to get better?</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>John 5:4 – For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</strong> There is no shortage or failure in God. A certain man is applicable to all of us. Have you ever been hurt, alone or in a situation where you needed someone and couldn&rsquo;t find them?</p>
    <p><br>
      Man has a tendency to attribute our faults, failures and hurts to others. We blame others for what happens. But most of what we can be is attached to how we see ourselves. Some see themselves as underachievers. As a man thinketh, so is he. <br>
      Others may stop you temporarily, but only you can do it permanently. We are people of faith. We thing, hope and wish, but we must get up and do. In Christ we can do the impossible. </p>
    <p><br>
      Knowledge of ability is the introduction of responsibility. <strong>Proverbs 4:20 – My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. </strong>We&rsquo;re in a war, whether you realize it or not. When you name the name of Christ you&rsquo;re involved. When we look at people and decisions being made it lets us know that we&rsquo;re at war. </p>
    <p><br>
      The weapons of our warfare are not carnal. The issue you&rsquo;re going through now is being used as a tool to develop you. Some don&rsquo;t come to church until they&rsquo;re in trouble. </p>
    <p><br>
      The fear of God must be the foundation to which knowledge is built. Get wisdom and get understanding. All that we know is infinitely less than what&rsquo;s left to be known. You don&rsquo;t know everything. </p>
    <p><br>
      Don&rsquo;t assume you know me by what you&rsquo;ve heard. I grow daily, so what you think you k now is out of date.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Romans 8:28 – And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. </strong>I can&rsquo;t explain how but I know that it&rsquo;s working for our good. Unless you know God has already provided healing, you won&rsquo;t know that he heals.</p>
    <p><br>
      Meditate on the word day and night. Man will let you down.  Stop listening to everyone. Trust in the Lord. Do you want to be made whole? Be careful how you answer questions. We are committed to what we confess. </p>
    <p><br>
      Do you want to better or do you want to remain bitter? You will never leave where you are until you decide where you would rather be. That&rsquo;s why some work their whole lives and never get promoted. Why some stay in bad relationships. God will take you as far as you want to go, but he can&rsquo;t take you further than where you want to be.</p>
    <p><br>
      Someone brought him to the pool, if he was there for 38 years. If you look hard enough you can find an excuse for not moving beyond your situations. <br>
      Failure is not an event – it&rsquo;s an option. When the mind is conditioned to accept second best, anything that comes along will do. That&rsquo;s why people stay in bad relationships.</p>
    <p><br>
      What you tolerate you can&rsquo;t change. Jesus asked him a question and he offered an excuse. </p>
    <p><br>
      The greatest quality on earth is the willingness to become. Never be satisfied with where you are. It could be better.</p>
    <p><br>
      Look for the better in every area of your life. </p>
    <p><br>
      We are motivated to become what we imagine ourselves to be. Leave where you used to be and go where you ought to be. When I know who I am, I break free of negativity. </p>
    <p><br>
      I&rsquo;m an overcomer. Difficulties aren&rsquo;t obstacles, they develop your character. Enjoyment of life is not based upon enjoyable circumstances.</p>
    <p><br>
      The joy of the Lord is my strength. When I think of the goodness of Jesus, I can get happy in a storm, all by myself.</p>
    <p><br>
      Do you want to be well? Don&rsquo;t let anyone build your world for you. People will come into your life and tell you what you can&rsquo;t do.</p>
    <p><br>
      There&rsquo;s so much more for you. Begin to think like a winner.</p>
    <p><br>
      This is the day the Lord has made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. I will praise him for who he is and what he&rsquo;s done for me. </p>
    <p><br>
      Think like who you are – A winner that will never lose again. </p>
    <p><br>
      When the enemy thinks he&rsquo;s got you down, keep fighting. </p>

    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Hebrews 12:1, John 10:10, Psalm 16:8, 1 Chronicles 1:17, Ephesians 2:10, 2 Corinthians 3:5, Jeremiah 29:11, Proverbs 4:7, 1 Peter 1:3, Matthew 10:37</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Going to the Next Level
    </p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong></p>
    <p>Have you ever asked yourself, why am I here? Why was I born? Why is there a void in my life? Why am I not fulfilled in my current circumstance?<br>
      God can do great things for us, but he can&rsquo;t do anything if you love where you are. There is nothing more tragic than living a life they don&rsquo;t enjoy.<br>
      John 10:10 – I come that you may have an abundant life. Abundant life transcends stuff. There are people with abundant stuff, that are miserable. <br>
      Psalm 16:8 – When you get to a place where the sun stops shining we must remain still. God is God and I am not. </p>
    <p><br>
      Stop taking God&rsquo;s business into your own hands.<br>
      God died for us, we don&rsquo;t deserve it, it&rsquo;s a gift. To receive it you must understand your purpose and your potential. God isn&rsquo;t trying to make you something new, he&rsquo;s trying to expose the real you.</p>
    <p><br>
      Don&rsquo;t worry about the outward man.<br>
      Understand your purpose. If you have no purpose you have no self-control and no boundaries. </p>
    <p><br>
      Drug use, promiscuity, deceitfulness of riches in these perilous times. The church has gotten caught up in this mess. If it doesn&rsquo;t align with the word of God it&rsquo;s not OK. Everything that&rsquo;s not of God is sin. We need to have a Godly attitude and walk in holiness. Unless the Lord watches the city the watchman labors in vain. Unless the Lord build the house it built in vain. </p>
    <p><br>
      God gave us the answer. 1 Chronicles 1:17 – If my people will humble themselves, I&rsquo;ll heal the land. </p>
    <p><br>
      Cry out to the Lord. Get on your knees. You can&rsquo;t talk about potential without God. </p>
    <p><br>
      Ephesians 2:10 – We need God.<br>
      2 Corinthians 3:5 – our sufficiency is from God. He is my strength, miracle worker, healer, deliverer. He is God.<br>
      When you need help, counsel, joy and peace don&rsquo;t go running to the store – run to Jesus. When you need a financial blessing get out of 7-11.<br>
      God supplies all of our needs. Stop filling out Publisher Clearing House. <br>
      You were created with potential for a specific purpose. Knowledge without action is overwhelming. <br>
      <br>
      Proverbs 4:7 – To be overcomers you must be who God wants you to be.<br>
      God told Abraham to get out of his father&rsquo;s house. In order to fulfill your purpose you&rsquo;re going to have to leave some people because they&rsquo;re not going anywhere. Why get connected to someone who won&rsquo;t fulfill your dreams? Some people have no plan or purpose. Connect yourself to a winner.</p>
    <p><br>
      Don&rsquo;t let anyone else build your world for you. They will build it too small.<br>
      Be careful of what goes through your ear-gate. Faith comes by hearing. Evil communication corrupts good manners. We already have it – get out of your comfort zone. You&rsquo;ll never get where you need to be until you leave where you are now. </p>
    <p><br>
      1 Peter 1:3 – You have the power. Power is the ability to walk away from what you desire to save what you love. </p>
    <p><br>
      Some things aren&rsquo;t sinful, just untimely. Some relationships aren&rsquo;t sinful, they are just untimely. </p>
    <p><br>
      Lay aside every wake.</p>
    <p><br>
      Your thought life – as a man thinketh so is he.<br>
      Be careful of your thoughts. <br>
      Stop focusing on where you are and pay attention to what you can have.<br>
      If you&rsquo;re in the same place you were in last year, there is a problem.<br>
      Block negativity. Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be bound by barriers of the past.<br>
      Let it Go!</p>
    <p><br>
      Forget about those things, don&rsquo;t be bound by that. <br>
      The enemy&rsquo;s fiery darts – he sows them and it speaks to your mind. He recalls past hurts to your remembrance. <br>
      Lay aside every weight. </p>
    <p><br>
      Unbelief is a big hindrance – you pray but you don&rsquo;t believe that God will do what you ask him to do. <br>
      You are what you imagine yourself to be.</p>
    <p><br>
      I can&rsquo;t deal with you until I&rsquo;m right with God. God demands total commitment. <br>
      <br>
      Choose ye this day who ye will serve. <br>
      God&rsquo;s ways are higher than our ways. He makes sacrifices for the whole. He will allow few to perish to gain the attention of the whole. </p>

    <h1>Apply the Word to your Life</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  September 2, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image35"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Apply the Word to your Life</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 Peter 5:8, John 10:10, 2 Corinthians 5:17, Romans 12:1, Romans 8:5, Psalm 37, Romans 7:18, Psalm 133:10, James 4:4, John 15:18, 1 John 4:17, Matthew 5, Colossians 2:9 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Once you know something – you must apply it to your life. Everything we see appeals to the flesh. 1 Peter 5:8 – the devil can devour those who don&rsquo;t know the truth. The works of the devil were destroyed at Calvary. He has no power but he perpetuates lies to destroy families and relationships. </p>
    <p>He&rsquo;s the chief liar – a deceiver. We must live discipline lifestyles. Whatsoever the Lord says, I will do. Sometimes we must please God when we don&rsquo;t understand. We must live lives that align with the word. </p>
    <p>John 10:10 – The devils agenda is to steal, kill and destroy. </p>
    <p>How do you have an abundant life? Get the word on the inside, so you don&rsquo;t sin. You can&rsquo;t wait until the enemy comes for on to the word. </p>
    <p>The spirit led life is always in conflict with the flesh. You will have trials and affliction, but we must remember that he will deliver us. </p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re going through something keep going. He will deliver you. </p>
    <p>When we receive Christ – the spirit man became alive. 2 Corinthians 5:17 – All things have passed away but I must still deal with the flesh. Salvation transformed my mind – not my body. There&rsquo;s an internal struggle. Before you were saved the things you desired. Your body still wants to do those things. </p>
    <p>Romans 12:1 – </p>
    <p>Stop living up with what the world is doing. I must do what the word of God says. I have to think. </p>
    <p>We need preparation in order to withstand the schemes and methods of the devil. The enemy wants to make a road into your life through your thought life. </p>
    <p>What priority do I place on things?</p>
    <p>Am I still thinking in the old life?</p>
    <p>Cast down imaginations! The contrary thoughts come against the knowledge of God. Our thoughts control our attitude. </p>
    <p>Romans 8:5 – You must walk in the spirit. If I walk in the spirit I&rsquo;m walking in love. </p>
    <p>Born again people can&rsquo;t lay their religion down. We can&rsquo;t do it on our own. God keeps us. Even when we&rsquo;re on the edge – He&rsquo;s in control. There&rsquo;s a greater good for a lot of the things we experience.</p>
    <p>Psalm 37 – The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. </p>
    <p>Romans 7:18 – in my flesh dwells no good thing and God knows all about it. The hair on our head is numbered. He knows which hair is being cut at the Barber shop.</p>
    <p>The flesh doesn&rsquo;t know how to do good. Psalm 133:10 – The works of the flesh isn&rsquo;t just your body – it&rsquo;s your will, your mind and your imaginations. We walk like Jesus walks – we live like Jesus lived. Walking in the spirit brings freedom from the world. </p>
    <p>James 4:4 – Friends of the world are enemies with God. When you&rsquo;re in Christ you can endure persecution. </p>
    <p>John 15:18 – We need to give evidence of the spirit in our lives. We were bought with a price. </p>
    <p>1 John 4:17 – Get rid of habits that make you back-slide. You must be consistent. No matter how tempting it looks or what comes in our lives. </p>
    <p>Matthew 5 – Make use of your spiritual weapons. Ephesians 6:10 – </p>
    <p>Colossians 2:9 – You are complete in Jesus. We don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere else for anything else. I&rsquo;m complete in him. I don&rsquo;t have to lie, gamble, steal or beg. </p>
    <p>Think on the goodness of Jesus. Be determined to walk in the spirit. </p>

    <h1>There is a Fungus among Us</h1>

  <div data-role="content"><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  September 6, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image34"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> There is a Fungus among Us</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Romans 1:21, Hosea 4:6, John 3:19 – 20, 2 Timothy 2:5, Matthew 8:9, Hosea 13:16, Isaiah 29:13, Ephesians 5:5-6, Proverbs 14, Mathew 7:13, Isaiah 1:59 </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      In the modern day church, the church has become powerless to have any impact on the evil around our society.</p>
    <p>Murder, abortion, teen pregnancy, sex assaults and everything that&rsquo;s not of God is on the rise, while the church has sequestered themselves behind stained glass windows. The church has become self-centered and ritualistic in our worship of God. We&rsquo;ve placed God in a box. If it&rsquo;s not in the prescribed time that you think should be done – you shut down. </p>
    <p>Whenever the saints of God come together – the enemy enters. The Devil is a demonic spirit and the only way he can operate in the earth&rsquo;s realm he needs a body. Every time we come together someone in the midst has a spirit of derailment and destruction. </p>
    <p>Some people are in church with a form of Godliness and will delay or distract the purpose of God.  God called us to be a witness, a force and something other than what we are. </p>
    <p>Worship God not buildings, worship God and not stuff. Worship God!</p>
    <p>Romans 1:21 – When they knew God, they became vain in their imaginations. </p>
    <p>Praise isn&rsquo;t merely nodding your head and saying Amen. Sin is essentially a lack of faith. A sickness is prevailing in our society. Lack of faith produces sin. In every war there will be casualties, captives and deserters. When Satan gets you captive he doesn&rsquo;t draw you away from church he leaves you there to stir up strife. </p>
    <p>Hosea 4:6 – Lack of knowledge. </p>
    <p>The spiritual world is more real than the physical world. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s by God&rsquo;s grace that you&rsquo;re here. Jesus had you in his plans before you made up your mind to come to church. </p>
    <p>He look beyond our faults and saw our need. We&rsquo;re doing evil in the sight of God. </p>
    <p>John 3:19 – 20 – Men love darkness rather than light. If you come to the light you will be exposed. So you stay in the dark. </p>
    <p>2 Timothy 2:5 – Unholy, unthankful, truce breakers, traitors, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Stop hanging with people like this. Stop hanging with the whisperers and backbiters. There should be a difference about you. You are a new creature. </p>
    <p>There are those who masquerade as Christians they&rsquo;ve been doing it so long. Matthew 8:9 </p>
    <p>Josea 13:16 – There are some who rebel against all authority. </p>
    <p>There is a complete absence of respect for the law, word and God. </p>
    <p>Isaiah 29:13 – They&rsquo;ve removed their heart from me. Disobedience to God leads to punishment whatsoever a man sow there shall he reap.</p>
    <p>Ephesians 5:5-6 – </p>
    <p>The word of God is for the people of God. </p>
    <p>God loves us, be he doesn&rsquo;t tolerate sin. </p>
    <p>Proverbs 14</p>
    <p>Mathew 7:13 – Wide is the gate and broad is the way to destruction.</p>
    <p>In order to pray you must have a relationship with God a right relationship.</p>
    <p>Isaiah 1:59 – Your iniquity has separated you from God. If there&rsquo;s sin in your life, no matter how much you pray – God won&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t let others try to condemn you. He that the son set free is free indeed. Don&rsquo;t allow people to take you back to your place. </p>
    <p>Whatever is in your heart and your life that&rsquo;s contrary to God&rsquo;s word. Humble yourself, pray and seek his face, turn from your wicked ways.</p>
    <p>Stop gossiping and whispering your arms are too short to box with God. </p>
    <p>If you volunteer to do something you can quit but if you were called – you can&rsquo;t quit. There is no way you can go to get away from what you must do.</p>
    <p>God knows all about you. He knows the hours on your head. </p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to fight your own battles. </p>

    <p><strong>Sermon Date:</strong>  September 20, 2015</p>
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image33"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Salvation</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> James 2:19, 2 Peter 1:3, Ephesians 1:3, 2 Timothy 1:9, Ephesians 2:5, John 8:31 – 32, 1 John 2:24, John 5:24, 1 John 2:3, 1 John 3:10, Ephesians 1:3, Isaiah 26:3, Psalm 34: 9-10, Psalm 62:5-7 &amp; 11</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Notes:</strong><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Salvation is not just a mental ascent. <strong>James 2:19</strong> – Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. Even the demons believe in God. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong> – According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. Our faith couldn&rsquo;t make anything happen, if God hadn&rsquo;t already don&rsquo;t it. Man must accept the finished work of Christ. </p>
    <p>Faith couldn&rsquo;t make it happen unless Jesus already provided. Whatever we&rsquo;re waiting on, is already provided. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> – Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Salvation is a completed action. </p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:9</strong> – Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. Salvation is a state of being. </p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 2:5</strong> – Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved. Some have decided not to change. There must be evidence. No one should have to ask if you are saved. </p>
    <p>You should be so inebriated with the Holy Ghost that others should feel it. <strong>John 8:31 – 32</strong> – Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. You can&rsquo;t be a disciple of God if you&rsquo;re not continuing in the word. Unless you continue in the word, you won&rsquo;t know the truth and you won&rsquo;t be focused.</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 2:24</strong> – Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. You can&rsquo;t know Jesus without knowing the word. <strong>John 5:24</strong> – Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. You hear it then you believe it. Saved people have resources. We have the victory. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 2:3</strong> – And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. Keep his commandments. Keeping his commandments is evidence that we know him. </p>
    <p>Love not the world. You can&rsquo;t mix the world and the word. </p>
    <p>God hates sin, but loves everyone. Keep his commandments and reject the world. Love each other, love other Christians, no matter their denomination. There should be no separation. </p>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:10</strong> – In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. If you don&rsquo;t love your brother the love of the father isn&rsquo;t in you. </p>
    <p>Is your lifestyle one that&rsquo;s waiting for Jesus or are you running Helter Skelter, everywhere?</p>
    <p>Be careful what you watch and what you listen to. Your eye-gate and ear-gate have great impact on your character. What are you listening to? What are you watching?</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> – Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. We were chosen in him before the foundation of the world. There was nothing you could do besides accept what he&rsquo;s already done. </p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah 26:3</strong> – Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Discipline your mind to be on him. </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 34: 9-10 - </strong>O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.<strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 62:5-7 &amp; 11 - </strong>5&nbsp;My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 6&nbsp;He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. 7&nbsp;In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 11&nbsp;God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.</p>

    <h1>Spiritual Warfare</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> September 16, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image44"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> John 17, 2 Corinthians 10:3-4, Ephesians 6:12, Romans 12:16, 1 Corinthians 1:18, Mathew 4, Ephesians 6:10, Luke 10:19, Acts 1:8, Romans 7, 1 Corinthians 9 
    <p><strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> </p>
    <p><br>
    We are in the world but not of the world. <strong>John 17</strong> – We have a purpose in the world. <br>
    <br>
      Whenever you&rsquo;re under spiritual attack, know that you have the victory. You also need to know how to recognize a spiritual attack. <br>
      <br>
      Once its identified where do you go from there. <strong>2 Corinthians 10:3-4</strong> – We don&rsquo;t fight our wars with physical weapons.<br>
      <br>
      We need to know what the weapons are and how to fight because every born again believer needs to know how to fight. We will all face adversity. <strong>Ephesians 6:12</strong> – High places – there is a realm that we must deal with. <br>
      <br>
      He takes over your mind. How you think – your mindset and how you respond to things. Responding negatively takes you out of where you are. It&rsquo;s the little things that comes to irritate us. The adversary will use whatever he has to distract/deceive. <br>
      <br>
      The enemy will come but he won&rsquo;t be successful. Pride and intelligence must be removed. We can&rsquo;t reason when comes to the word of God. <br>
      God calls us to be unified body.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 12:16</strong> – Be humble, you don&rsquo;t know everything. Let the spirit give full revelation. Don&rsquo;t argue scripture. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>1 Corinthians 1:18</strong> – Use spiritual weapons to defeat opposition. <br>
      <br>
    Weapons are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prayer</li>
      <li>The word of God</li>
      <li>Love – which is the most powerful weapon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No matter what&rsquo;s going on – continue to show love – no matter what&rsquo;s going on, no matter how they treat you. Because we have the power of the Holy Spirit in us. We have the power to love. We move away from conditional love. I love you because of who I am. <br>
      <br>
      People crucify us with their mouths and the things they do – we must pray for them like Jesus did – &ldquo;Father forgive them, they know not what they do&rdquo;. We have the Holy Spirit who teaches, strengthens and guides us. When we come into situations where we&rsquo;re being crucified we must say father forgive them. <br>
      It&rsquo;s amazing when you can take the abuse and continue to love. That&rsquo;s because of God. <br>
      <br>
      Wisdom and discernment are weapons to know when we&rsquo;re being attacked. The name of Jesus is a weapon – demons tremble at his name. <br>
      <br>
      We have power in the blood of Jesus. They are weapons. Praise and worship is a weapon. Give God thanks in the midst of it all. Any weapon we have is only as effective as your knowledge of how to use it. <br>
      <br>
      Satan doesn&rsquo;t respond to verbiage – he responds to knowledge. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Mathew 4</strong> – Lack of knowledge causes us to lose balance. <br>
  <strong>Ephesians 6:10</strong> – I can&rsquo;t be strong on my own. The enemy tries to draw us from our dependence on God. <br>
  <br>
      Prayer is very important if we want to win battles. We have the weapon but we must know how to use them. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Luke 10:19</strong> – Believe this word; verbalize this word daily. Verbalize that nothing by any means shall hurt you. I&rsquo;ll keep saying it because faith comes from hearing. <br>
  <strong>Acts 1:8</strong> – You shall receive power once the Holy Ghost comes and takes up residence in our lives. You&rsquo;ve got it now but to be victorious or live a victorious lifestyle. You need a disciplined thought life – cast down foolish thoughts. <br>
      You can&rsquo;t prevent the thoughts from coming, but you don&rsquo;t have to receive it. <br>
  <strong>Romans 7</strong> – The things I would do I don&rsquo;t do anymore – You have to deal with your flesh. In this flesh dwells no good thing. It&rsquo;s just a house for our spirit man. <br>
  <strong>1 Corinthians 9</strong> – I must control my body if I plan to witness to others. <br>
    Weapons of the Enemy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fear – fear of being overwhelmed by something that&rsquo;s greater than us</li>
      <li>Frustration – inability/lack of knowledge to make you give up</li>
      <li>False teachings – false prophets. You must know the word so you can examine it and discern between truth and a lie. </li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We need spiritual allies. It&rsquo;s good to have prayer partners.  The devil is fighting us so we lost faith in things. He attacks our assurance. <br>
      <br>
      The world is an enemy. The world has its own religions. They seek to seduce Christians into believing false doctrines.<br>
      <br>
    Human nature is an enemy. The flesh lusts to get us to do contrary things to what the word of God says. </p>

    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image45"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>

    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> 2 Timothy 4:18, Romans 4:1, Romans 5:1 -2, Romans 3:23, Colossians 1:21 – 23, Psalm 51:5, 1 Corinthians 10:22, 1 John 4:10, Galatians 2:20, 1 John 2:6, 1 John 2:3-4, Titus 2:11-13, Matthew 22, 1 Peter 2 <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Salvation Part 2<br>
    <br>
    Soteria is the Greek word for Salvation; it means deliverance, healing, peace, prosperity and joy. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 4:18</strong> – We look at the transformation of a person&rsquo;s nature through repentance and faith in the finished work of Christ. Not obtained by any human effort. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 4:1</strong> – The faith of Abraham. He was humanly speaking, the founder of the Jewish nation. He believed God and God counted his righteousness because of his faith. <br>
    <br>
    Salvation is a change of status before God, by faith. <br>
    <strong>Romans 5:1 -2</strong> – Being justified with faith we have peace with God. <br>
    We have peace of God, peace with God and peace of God on earth. <br>
    You who were sometimes far off in relationship not distance. <br>
    <br>
    All through the New Testament you find out about salvation. <strong>Colossians 1:21 – 23</strong> We were enemies of God. <strong>Romans 3:23</strong> – All have sinned and come short of God&rsquo;s glory. <strong>Psalm 51:5</strong> – When Adam sinned in the garden. The sin was passed on to all mankind. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 10:22</strong> – All are made alive. Christ died to pay a debt that he did not owe to free us from a debt we could not pay. <strong>1 John 4:10</strong> – <br>
    By grace you&rsquo;re saved. It is the free gift, unmerited favor by God. We have nothing to brag about. <br>
    <br>
    Baptism is the result of receiving Christ beforehand. <br>
    <br>
    Speaking in tongues is the result of being saved but not a requirement. Speaking in tongues is a gift. <br>
    <br>
    Your language changes even in church if the spirit doesn&rsquo;t lead. <br>
    Paul said I keep under my body. Because it wants to do it&rsquo;s own thing. Temptation comes daily, don&rsquo;t yield to it. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Galatians 2:20</strong> – Crucified with Christ. He lives in me. When we are saved – we are saved with a purpose. Each of us has a gift we are all able to do something in the church. <br>
    <br>
    Purpose to live a holy lifestyle. When I&rsquo;m saved I don&rsquo;t have to announce it or tote a bible around. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 2:6</strong> – He that abideth in him – walk as he walked. We have the power to do. The saved obey God&rsquo;s word. <br>
    <br>
    We obey the laws of the land but we must also obey God&rsquo;s law. Forsake not the assemblies of yourself. Worship is an important part of Church. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 2:3-4</strong> – If we keep his commandments we love him. They&rsquo;re not hard to keep. We must delight in God&rsquo;s word. Psalm 119:43 – Our life with Christ is a relationship. We must participate to increase the bond. You have to work on it. <br>
    Our lifestyles should be Christ-like. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Titus 2:11-13</strong> – <br>
    No one knows when he&rsquo;s coming so we must live soberly, righteously and Godly in this present world. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 22</strong> – Love God and love your neighbors as yourself. If you keep those two commandments, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything else. <br>
    The saved person is obedient to the word of God. <br>
    <br>
    Once we finish the topic on salvation and characteristics of the saved. There are benefits to being obedient to God&rsquo;s word. Don&rsquo;t let it enter your mind that you did something to be saved. You only followed/yielded to something that was already in place. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Peter 2</strong> – We were saved before the foundation of the world. We are a chosen generation a royal priesthood. <br>
    <br>
    Now that we are God&rsquo;s people, there are some things that we shouldn&rsquo;t do. You don&rsquo;t lose everything overnight. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up when you don&rsquo;t reach the level you think you should be. It&rsquo;s a process. <br>
    <br>
    Things will begin to drop out of your life. <br>
    <br>
  We are the light of the world. Tell someone about God.                  </div>

  <div data-role="content"><strong>Date:</strong> September 30, 2015
    <div class="ui-li-aside" id="image46"><img src="bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Mark 11:25, Psalm 66:18, Philippians 4:19, Mark 11:22, Psalm 119:130, 2 Timothy 4:16, 2 Timothy 2, Romans 5:3-4, Timothy 1:8, James 1:2, Nehemiah 6:15, Acts 3:1, Acts 16:22, James 5:15, Hebrews 11:6, Revelations 12:11, Ephesians 6:15, 2 Corinthians 10:5, Ephesians 6:10<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth - Prayer<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Corinthians 10:5</strong> – The weapons are not carnal. We have weapons. <strong>Ephesians 6:10</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>Weapons</u></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Word of God</li>
      <li>Name of Jesus</li>
      <li>Blood of Jesus</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How do we get the weapons to the point of attack? We have the weapons and to get them ready for attack. <br>
      <br>
    <strong><u>We need:</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prayer</li>
      <li>Preaching</li>
      <li>Testimony</li>
      <li>Worship</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prayer has great power. When we pray the name of Jesus. Prayer is the greatest force in the universe. When a Christian prays their ability is multiplied 3-fold. Whatever plagues you in the physical realm emanates from the spiritual realm. <br>
      Everything starts in the spiritual. <strong>Ephesians 6:15</strong> – Praying always with supplication in the spirit. Prayer is a weapon. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>James 5:15</strong> – We already have all things. We give victory by our testimony – <strong>Revelations 12:11</strong> – your testimony is a weapon. <br>
  <br>
      Praise and worship is a powerful weapon. He inhabits the praise of his people. Make your request in the midst of praise and worship. Whenever you use the weapon, never forget <strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong> – We still need faith. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Acts 16:22</strong> – Paul and Silas were in the maximum security prison. At midnight Paul and Silas in that environment, in the dark hour of the night, began to sing praises to God. The natural mind wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, because the prisoner was charged to keep them. <br>
  <br>
      In the midst of prayer and praise the prison shook and all the doors opened. The chains fell loose. Remember this is the same God. Whatever we&rsquo;re dealing with this is the same God who can see us through. <br>
      <br>
      Same God yesterday, today and forever more. God is no respecter of person. If he did it for Paul and Silas, he will do it for you. </p>
    <p><strong>Acts 3:1</strong> – There is power in the name of Jesus. When the scripture says they went into the temple together. They were on one accord, one mindedness and one in spirit. <br>
      <br>
      Whenever you&rsquo;re in worship you must get rid of any distractions. Set my mind to be in the environment of praise and worship. <br>
      <br>
      When we enter the temple we must acknowledge and allow the spirit to do what it&rsquo;s doing. <br>
      <br>
      We need to be in the mindset of worship – no matter what – nothing matters but worship. <br>
      <br>
      Peter and John were unified when responding to the lame man. Silver and Gold I have none which means – the normal you&rsquo;re seeking. I don&rsquo;t have, but he by the power of Christ, healed the lame man. Immediately he leaped and walked. Once the lame man received the miracle he went into the temple when God delivers, he makes a way for us to do what we&rsquo;ve never done before. Maintain a positive attitude. Positive attitude helps you overcome ridicule. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Nehemiah 6:15</strong> – They overcame ridicule. Everyone won&rsquo;t agree with you and everyone isn&rsquo;t going to be with you. <br>
  <br>
      When people speak contrary to the word, we must control our emotions and attitudes. <strong>James 1:2</strong> – Count it all joy. <br>
      <br>
      Understand the value of difficult times. <strong>Romans 5:3-4</strong> – Glory in tribulation. In the midst of tribulation you can see the positive. <br>
      <br>
      It&rsquo;s not if you&rsquo;ll have difficult times, it&rsquo;s when. We&rsquo;re all sealed and sanctified but we are the &ldquo;Salt of the earth&rdquo;, we will be tested. <br>
      <br>
      No matter what&rsquo;s going on there are seasons. There are seasons of afflictions – <strong>Timothy 1:8</strong> – the midst of dealing with the issues of life – there is a lesson to learned, whether positive or negative. <br>
      <br>
      What is the Lord showing me at this moment. Never say, God where are you? He has already promised that he is always with us. He won&rsquo;t leave us nor forsake us. <br>
      The adversary uses pressure to get you out of your place of peace and contentment. You must realize that God gets the glory from it all. You get the victory and I&rsquo;ll get the glory. Seasons of contention <strong>2</strong> <strong>Timothy 2</strong> – The word of God will stand for itself. We must be gentle and patient with all men. <br>
      Seasons of isolation – <strong>2 Timothy 4:16</strong> – Lord have mercy on those who forsake me. <br>
      <br>
      God&rsquo;s thoughts are so above ours. Paul was right in the crowd of people who forsake him. Recognize the seasons during these times – block out negativity. Don&rsquo;t agree with the enemy. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Psalm 119:130</strong> – Your words give light. When the enemy tries to bind and remind you put the word on it. We are new creatures in Christ. We&rsquo;ve been redeemed, washed and set aside. <br>
  <br>
      We praise God for the finished word of Christ. I need to have confidence in his past deliverance, confidence in his word, and confidence in Christ. <br>
  <strong>Mark 11:22</strong> – Whosoever encompasses us all, believe that you received them and you shall have whatever you say.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:19</strong> – there are needs and desires. Whatsoever you desire when you pray you will have. SO we get what we need and what we desire. <br>
      Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.<br>
      Act like it&rsquo;s so, we already have what we need. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Mark 11:25</strong> – When you pray you must forgive. You can&rsquo;t make a request known with an ought against someone. <br>
  <br>
    Forgiveness makes way for the blessings. <strong>Psalm 66:18</strong> – If I have iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me. </p>

    <br>
    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Jeremiah 27:1, 2 Corinthians 11:13-15, Leviticus 19:28, Joshua 1:8, Acts 16:16, Romans 6:16, Ephesians 6:10, Mark 16:17, Psalm 91:13-14, Philippians 4:6, 2 Corinthians 4:8, 2 Peter 1:3 <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bible Study Topic:</strong> Spiritual Growth - Prayer<br>
    <br>
    The main thing to guard against is thoughts. Don&rsquo;t allow the enemy to put a stronghold in your mind. It may start as innocent, but as long as it stays in your mind it builds a root. <br>
    <br>
    You can study the word on your own, but we all need to be taught. There&rsquo;s a difference between reading the word and studying the word. <br>
    <br>
    The enemy tries to get you into a place of disobedience like speaking against a pastor. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Jeremiah 27:1</strong> – God will deal with every Pastor and teacher that doesn&rsquo;t speak the truth. Don&rsquo;t rush to be a teacher. <br>
    <br>
    You must recognize the bondage:
    <ul>
      <li>Negative thoughts</li>
      <li>Irrational feelings</li>
      <li>Habitual sins – been going on so long it no longer bothers the person</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have a materialistic view, we&rsquo;re concerned about the here and now. Spiritual battles can impact our church family and cultural lives. <br>
      <br>
      It attacks us through false religion. <strong>2 Corinthians 11:13-15</strong> – There are ministers of the world that aren&rsquo;t ministers of Christ. Satan transforms himself as light, just as ministers change themselves into ministers of light. You need discernment. <br>
      Be lead by the spirit. <br>
      <br>
    Weapons of the Adversary</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Messages that tickle your ears with no substance</li>
      <li>Fear</li>
      <li>Frustration</li>
      <li>Fatigue – when you&rsquo;re very tired and then the enemy comes along</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We must be mindful – watch as well as pray. <strong>Leviticus 19:28</strong> – Speaks about tattoos. A lot of symbols are demonic. Do you know what the symbol means. Watch our children – video games are demonic. <br>
      <br>
      Astrology is not Godly!<br>
      <br>
      Charms the origin – the enemy wants you to think it&rsquo;s decoration. So subtle that you don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. <br>
      <br>
      Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, which dwells in us. Can&rsquo;t place things on the temple. <br>
      <br>
      There are things that God created but Satan tries to turn it into something evil. Keep your heart with all diligence. <strong>Joshua 1:8</strong> – Keys to living a holy spiritual life. <br>
      <br>
      Get the knowledge to understand that you can&rsquo;t fight these battles from a non-spiritual standpoint. <br>
      <br>
      You&rsquo;ll come across contrary people don&rsquo;t allow yourself to grow angry or bitter. That&rsquo;s the enemy. <br>
      <br>
      You must take control of the situation. <strong>Acts 16:16</strong> – He spoke to the spirit, not to the girl. Paul delivered, using the authority of Jesus name. The weapon was the word. <br>
      <br>
      If something is going on with a family member find out where the access point was. How did the thought get in your spirit. Who have I yielded to, associated with or allowed in my house. <br>
      <br>
      Everyone comes with a spirit. It&rsquo;s so subtle when you notice it, it&rsquo;s already there so now you must deal with it. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>Romans 6:16</strong> – I can&rsquo;t allow those things to remain in my life. Don&rsquo;t dwell, be angry but sin not. Whatever it is settle it now. Eliminate the right of passage by repenting for our sins. Always remember it&rsquo;s the spirit, it&rsquo;s not the flesh.<br>
  <strong>Ephesians 6:10</strong> – We wrestle not with the flesh and blood. Remember that when people are acting out. When the enemy can get you to respond as the person responded, he got you. <br>
  <br>
      Remember, the Lord is listening. Not only does he hear – so does the adversary. He can&rsquo;t read our mind, but he uses what we say.<br>
      <br>
      You must evict that spirit. <strong>Mark 16:17</strong> – for the believers. Everything written in the Bible is for our learning. Our character, our walk must be aligned with the word of God, in order to do those things. <br>
      <br>
      He&rsquo;s given us power and authority. We have delegated authority. It&rsquo;s not being used. <br>
      <br>
      If you have the faith to believe and the boldness to act, the authority will work. We will have opposition to the promise – the enemy. But we have power over the enemy. I love the Lord with my whole heart, soul, mind and strength. We are more than conquerors. <strong>Psalm 91:13-14</strong> – Because he loves me I will deliver him. <br>
      He leads me in the path of righteousness for his namesake. Don&rsquo;t worry about anything else. <br>
      <br>
      Because we love him – he delivers us – whatever it is – he will deliver us. We must have the patience to wait and don&rsquo;t set a time limit on God for deliverance. <br>
  <strong>Philippians 4:6</strong> – don&rsquo;t get nervous, if it doesn&rsquo;t happen in two or three days. Stay in your lane. <br>
  <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow your belief system to change. <strong>2 Corinthians 4:8</strong> – Winning must take place in our minds before it becomes a reality in your life. To be a winner you need to think like a winner, seek those things above. <br>
      <br>
      Sow the seed of victory into your thought realm.<br>
      <br>
      Rehearse the scripture – say what God says about us – it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the enemy is doing. <br>
      <br>
      It won&rsquo;t affect my character.<br>
      <br>
      Don&rsquo;t allow the enemy to change your conversations. Some things shouldn&rsquo;t be verbalized. <br>
      <br>
      You can cause your own demise by what you say. <br>
      <br>
      Purpose to speak faith-filled words. Don&rsquo;t allow the enemy to change your conversation. <br>
      <br>
      Our mouths become the vehicle to wage war. <br>
      <br>
  <strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong> – We have been given all things that pertain to life and godliness. It&rsquo;s not what we do that determines what we do. It&rsquo;s who we are that determines what we do.<br>
  <br>
      We need to maintain a positive attitude. There&rsquo;s value in being positive. Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the word of the Lord. <br>
  <br>
    Maintain the positive attitude. </p>

    <strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 Corinthians 15:4, 1 John 1:2, 2 Corinthians 6:14, 1 Corinthians 5, 1 Corinthians 2:10, 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, Psalm 26:2, Psalm 24:3, 1 Corinthians 11:28, Hebrews 9:22, Leviticus 17:11, 1 Peter 18:19, Ephesians 2:13, Romans 3:23, Acts 2:42, Matthew 26, Romans 5:8, 1 Corinthians 11:23 <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> World Communion Sunday Message<br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:23</strong> – This world communion Sunday was celebrated by the church to signify Christ&rsquo;s death for our sin. <strong>Romans 5:8</strong> – While we were sinners Christ died for us. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 26</strong>: As often as you do this. You don&rsquo;t have to wait until the first Sunday to do Communion. <strong>Acts 2:42</strong> – This was something they did daily. <br>
    Communion creates a relationship with believers and each others. <br>
    <br>
    The blood represents Christ&rsquo;s atoning work. There is nothing you can do to be saved on your won. It&rsquo;s by God&rsquo;s grace. <strong>Romans 3:23</strong> – All have sinned. <br>
    The blood cleansed us all from sins. <strong>Ephesians 2:13</strong> – We were far off. We weren&rsquo;t born to be anxious to be in Church. It took the blood. <strong>1 Peter 18:19</strong> – We couldn&rsquo;t purchase salvation. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Leviticus 17:11</strong> – Blood has great significance in the Bible. Blood and life are dependent on each other. Without shedding blood there&rsquo;s no remission of sin. <br>
    When Adam sinned; it came upon all of mankind. <strong>Hebrews 9:22</strong> – Christ died for the remission of our sins. Communion is the highest day of celebration. Don&rsquo;t take this lightly. This is a celebration. We should be prayerfully considering it. <br>
    Once the wine and bread has been consecrated it has already been the body and blood of Christ. <br>
    <br>
    We should have a holy attitude when we come to the table. <br>
    <br>
    If there is something between you and another, you must get it right. You can&rsquo;t come to the table with bitterness, hate or division in your heart.<br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s impossible to have communion between righteousness and unrighteousness. Fellowship with God demands a pure heart. <strong>Psalm 24:3</strong> – There must be preparation. <strong>1 Corinthians 11:28</strong> - We must examine ourselves. <br>
    You know what&rsquo;s in your life. <br>
    <br>
    The church was coming together for fellowship and a spiritual connection. <br>
    This is one of the most fearful things because it&rsquo;s a sure sign of backsliding and compromise. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 5:7-8</strong> – Communion purges these attitudes. <br>
    Before we come to the table we should be prepared <strong>Psalm 26:2</strong> – Examine me Lord.<br>
    <br>
    We are separated unto God. <strong>1 Corinthians 2:10</strong> – You can&rsquo;t drink from the cup of the Lord&rsquo;s and from the cup of the devil. <br>
    <br>
    The Lord keeps us. <strong>1 Corinthians 5</strong> – If any man is called a brother and involved in wickedness don&rsquo;t eat with them or fellowship with them. <br>
    Holiness is essential. <strong>2 Corinthians 6:14</strong> – You are the temple of the Holy Spirit. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 1:2</strong> – Don&rsquo;t love the world nor the things in it. <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:4</strong> – It&rsquo;s not the life of Jesus that saved us but the death and resurrection. <br>
    <br>
    We must look within. Examine yourself, look around and see the other saints of God. Wherever we can help, we help. Whatever it is, we are a forgiving people. There will be times when you&rsquo;re right and there&rsquo;s an issue with someone, you must be the person to make the first move. <br>
    <br>
  I can&rsquo;t live a fulfilled life if I&rsquo;m not in the right relationship with you.  </div>

    <p><strong>Scriptures:</strong> Leviticus 19:18, Matthew 5:4, Matthew 5:4 , John 3:16, Mathew  28:20, Leviticus 19:18, Genesis 1:26, Matthew 12:36, Mark 45:1</p>
    <p><strong>Sermon Topic:</strong> Laity Sunday – What is Laity</p>
    <p><strong>Presented by:  </strong>Sis. Cozette Gray</p>
    <p><strong>L = Love<br>
    </strong><br>
    Love is God’s greatest gift. God is love. <strong>John 3:16</strong> – without love we couldn’t make it. Anytime you give your only child for the world that’s love. If God can love like that, why can’t we? </p>
    <p><strong>Matthew 5:4 </strong>– This is a commandment we must keep. How can you love those who do you wrong? When you have God in you – everything about you changes. They should be able to see you in that light.</p>
    <p>We need to learn to listen – listen to God’s voice. The devil speaks to you too. You need to know who to listen to.</p>
    <p>Learn to laugh – we can’t be so heavenly minded that we are no earthly good.</p>
    <p><strong>A= Always<br>
    </strong><br>
      This is a six letter word with a lot of responsibility. Always – be ready to serve and always rejoice in the Lord. <strong>Mathew  28:20</strong> – go if you have to go by yourself. God never leaves you. He is with us always. In the mountain and in the valley. He always is there and he always keeps his promises.<br>
      <br>
    <strong>Luke 4:18</strong> – Anointed – we are anointed to preach the gospel. If you’re always serving God, always be in his image.</p>
    <p><strong>I= Image</strong><br>
      <br>
    Image – <strong>Genesis 1:26 </strong>– if we are going to be an image of God, we can’t do everything and go everywhere. We must be like God if we want to serve.<br>
    <br>
    God did it all – <strong>Matthew 12:36 </strong>– without God there is no I. Speak faith-filled words. Don’t be ignorant about God’s words. We need to study the Bible. Know the word in order to live the word. Lay servants have spiritual responsibilities.</p>
    <p><strong>T= Trust</strong><br>
      <br>
      “Oh Taste and see that the Lord is good”<br>
      Trust and obey. We must trust him to be our savior, comforter, shelter, bread, water, even the air we breathe. Whatever we need, he will be. No matter what, you’ll be tempted. As soon as you get busy for God, Satan gets busy for you.<br>
      <br>
    Testify – everyone is a testimony. When you get a chance to testify for God, let somebody know what God has done for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark 45:1</strong> – he give his life as a ransom to all of us. We can always find something to thank God for. Something to testify about. God has saved us and molded us in his image.<br>
    We must always be ready to tell someone about the God we serve.</p>
    <p><strong>Y=Yield</strong><br>
      <br>
    Yield not to temptation. Each victory we win will help others win. Say, “Yes Lord”. He is our power. He is faithful.</p>

  <div data-role="content"><br>

    <strong>Scriptures: </strong>2 Chronicles 20, Romans 8:35, 1 Peter 4:12, Chronicles 20:17
    <p><strong>Bible Study Notes:</strong><br>
    Difficult circumstances are allowed by God to test our faith. Persecution tests our faith, that’s why he allows it.</p>
    <p>Faith that hasn’t been tested hasn’t been tried. We have the assurance of faith.</p>
    <p>Whatever you’re going through, don’t waver in your faith that he won’t do what he promised. 2 Chronicles 20:17 – We have the assurance that what he promised he’ll bring to pass.<br>
      We don’t need to fight – stand still to see the salvation of the Lord.</p>
    <p>Stand still to see the deliverance. You must stand still because if you’re running around you may miss it. Stand Still.</p>
    <p>You can be so tied up in things that you become fearful.</p>
    <p>There are times when it looks like God’s not answering, but he is. That’s when we need the God-kind of faith. Regardless, I know that you’re working in my life.</p>
    <p>When you commit things to God, leave it. Don’t do anything contrary.<br>
      Your ears must be tuned to God’s word. It takes confidence.<br>
      We were made winners. We were made righteous. When I gave my life to Christ I became a winner.<br>
      Confidence allows us to endure difficult situations.</p>
    <p>1 Peter 4:12 – Prevents us from asking those unnecessary questions that we have. The word of God says that many are the afflictions of the righteous.<br>
      Don’t worry. God will deliver you.</p>
    <p>You must rehearse your victory. Prophesize over yourself.</p>
    <p>The devil can’t read your mind, he listens to what you say.</p>
    <p>That’s why he had a conversation with Eve because he couldn’t read her mind.</p>
    <p>Don’t worry about stuff.</p>
    <p>Don’t worry about not having enough. We are already abundantly blessed.</p>
    <p>He already knows what we have need of – What we need is already in place.</p>
    <p>All things were created and sustained for the benefits of the Christian.</p>
    <p>We have a better promise than the Israelites.</p>
    <p>Maintain the confidence in God’s presence and promises, not because of human merit but because of God’s graciousness.</p>
    <p>There’s a privilege of receiving divine insight. Privilege and authority. Authority is assured by God’s ability.</p>
    <p>Romans 8:35 – in other words all that the father has given me, I have lost nothing. No man can pluck it out of my hands.</p>
    <p>There is nothing you could do to stop Christ from loving you. He still loves us, no matter what.<br>
      Repent when you’re wrong. Confess the sin.</p>
    <p>There is none good – no not one.</p>
    <p>Not because of our goodness, but because of God’s mercy.<br>
      There may be times where we falter but nothing separates us from his love.<br>
      Go into every circumstance, knowing that you’re a winner, up front.</p>
    <p>2 Chronicles 20 – Stand still the battle isn’t yours, it’s the Lord’s. The one who fights our battles, is the same God who in the beginning where there was no light – said “Let there be light&quot;</p>
    <p>God knows the name of each star in the sky. That’s the same God that we serve.</p>
    <p>Nothing will separate us from his love. Not by our appearance but our character.<br>
      God looks at the heart. Are you loving each other?</p>
    <p>When we make our requests known that’s the first question to come into play.<br>
      We can’t worry about how people are to us. We have to love everyone. You don’t have to like what they do and you don’t have to associate with everyone. Evil communication corrupts good manners.</p>
    <p>If I’m walking in holiness and righteousness some folk may leave me, but that’s alright.<br>
      To walk in victory – these things must daily be a part of our being.</p>
    <p>Spend time with God. It’s not like nothing negative will come but when it comes, we have the victory.</p>
    <p>Trust in him. Stand fast in the liberty where Christ set you free.</p>
    <p>You can’t fix a spiritual problem using physical means.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to wait until you get to church to give a testimony.</p>
    <p>God gives us all kinds of opportunities to tell our testimony.</p>
